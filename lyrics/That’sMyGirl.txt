That's my girl

[Verse 1: Ally, Ally & Camila]
Yeah, who's been working so damn hard?
You got that head on overload?
Got yourself this flawless body
Achin' now from head to toe

[Refrain: Normani, Ally, Dinah & All]
Ain't nothin', ain't nothin' (Ooh, ah)
All my ladies 'round the world
Ain't nothin', ain't nothin' (Ooh, ah)
Good girls better get bad

[Pre-Chorus: Lauren & Camila]
You've been down before
You've been hurt before
You got up before
You'll be good to go, good to go

Destiny said it, you got to get up and get it
Get mad independent and don't you ever forget it
Got some dirt on your shoulder, then let me brush it off for ya
If you're feeling me, put your five high
That's my girl
