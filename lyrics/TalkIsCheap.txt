Oh, so, you're weak or I am
You doubt I'll bother reading into it
I probably won't, left to my own devices
But that's the difference in our opinions

You're a mouthful that amounts for
Another week on my own
Now I'm a novel, made resourceful
I start a chain with my thought

And talk is cheap, my darling
When you're feeling right at home
I wanna make you move with confidence
I wanna be with you alone
Said help me help you start it
You're too comfortable to know
You're throwing out those words
No, you gotta feel it on your own

Cold pain, I cannot sustain it
That's what I'm thinking, not what I'm drinking
I hold up my ways, these thoughts are pervasive
It's not a statement, but peace can be evasive
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
You're a mouthful that amounts for
Another week on my own
Now I'm a novel, made resourceful
I start a chain with my thought

And talk is cheap, my darling
When you're feeling right at home
I wanna make you move with confidence
I wanna be with you alone
Said help me help you start it
You're too comfortable to know
Throwing out those words
No, you gotta feel it on your own
And talk is cheap, my darling
When you're feeling right at home
I wanna make you move with confidence
I wanna be with you alone
Said help me help you start it
You're too comfortable to know
Throwing out those words
No, you gotta feel it on your own
