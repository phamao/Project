The make-up on his shirt
You don't believe his stories
You know that they're all lies
Bad as you are, you stick around and I just don't know why

If i was your man (baby you)
Never worry 'bout (what I do)
I'd be coming home (back to you)
Every night, doing you right
You're the type of woman (deserves good things)
Fistful of diamonds (hand full of rings)
Baby you're a star
I just want to show you are

You should let me love you
Let me be the one to
Give you everything you want and need
Baby, good love and protection
Make me your selection
Show you the way love's supposed to be
Baby you should let me love you

Baby your beauty's description
Looks so good that it hurts
I know you're a dime girl
But you don't know what you're worth
And everywhere you go they stop and stare
Cause you're bad and it shows
From your head to your toes
Out of control
Baby you know

If i was your man (baby you)
