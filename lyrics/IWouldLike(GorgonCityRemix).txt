You've got me playing in a game that ain't fair
But you're taking me there
Yeah, you're taking me there

(Oh) I can't help myself, it's human nature, human nature
Who's to say what's meant to be?
(Oh) Why can't we be on our worst behavior, worst behavior
When it comes so naturally?

I would like to get to know you, baby
Like to get under your sexy body
I would like to get to know you, baby
Like to get under your sexy body
Woah, woah
(Under your sexy body)
(Oh)

Know what you're doing whеn you hold her like that
(Like that)
Looking at mе to see if I'm looking back
But me and you both know where tonight is gon' lead
(Gon' lead)
Cause you're leaving with me
(Leaving with me)
Yeah, you're leaving with me, yeah
