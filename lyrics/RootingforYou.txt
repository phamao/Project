Let winter break
Let it burn 'til I see you again
I will be here with you
Just like I told you I would
I'd love to always love you
But I'm scared of loneliness
When I'm, when I'm alone with you

I know it's hard
Only you and I
Is it all for me?
Because I know it's all for you
And I guess, I guess
It is hell and, you are the only thing I've ever truly known
So, I hesitate, if I can act the same for you
And my darlin', I'll be rooting for you
And my darlin', I'll be rooting for you

And where did she go?
Truth left us long ago
And I need her tonight because I'm scared of loneliness with you, baby
And I should let it go
But all that is left is my perspective, broken and so left behind again

I know it's hard
Only you and I
Is it all for me?
Because I know it's all for you
And I guess, I guess
It is hell and you are the only thing I've ever truly known
So, I hesitate, if I can act the same for you
And my darlin', I'll be rooting for you
And my darlin', I'll be rooting for you
