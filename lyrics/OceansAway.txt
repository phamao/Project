I never let
My guard go down
But you messed me up
When you came around
When the high wore off
Know you needed space
But I don't wanna wait
I don't wanna mistake

Few thousand miles, and an ocean away
But I see the sunrise, just like the other day
Picture your eyes as I fall asleep
Tell myself it's alright
As the tears roll by

Oh, oh, oh
I wish I could feel your face
Oh, oh, oh
I'm helpless when I'm oceans away

I never felt
A room so still
See the future coming
Hope it isn't real
I learned to fake a smile
As the time runs out
I don't wanna wait
Oh, I don't wanna mistake

Few thousand miles and an ocean away
But I see the sunrise, just like the other day
Picture your eyes as I fall asleep
Tell myself it's alright, as the tears roll by

Oh, oh, oh
I wish I could feel your face
Oh, oh, oh
I'm helpless when I'm oceans away
Oh, oh, oh
I wish I could feel your face
Oh, oh, oh
I'm helpless when I'm oceans away

Helpless when I'm oceans away
I'm helpless when I'm oceans away

Oh, oh, oh
I wish I could feel your face
Oh, oh, oh
I'm helpless when I'm oceans away
