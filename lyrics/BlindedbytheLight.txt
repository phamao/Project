Blinded by the light
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night

Madman, drummers, bummers
Indians in the summer with a teenage diplomat
In the dumps with the mumps as the adolescent pumps his way into his hat
With a boulder on my shoulder, feelin' kinda older
I tripped the merry-go-round
With this very unpleasin', sneezin' and wheezin'
The calliope crashed to the ground

The calliope crashed to the ground!

But, she was blinded by the light
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night
Blinded by the light
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night
Blinded by the light
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night
Blinded by the light
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night

Some silicone sister with a manager mister
Told me I got what it takes
She said, "I'll turn you on, son, into something strong
Play the song with the funky break"
And go-kart Mozart was checkin' out the weather chart to see if it was safe outside
And little Early-Pearly came by in his curly-wurly and asked me if I needed a ride

Asked me if I needed a ride!

But, she was blinded by the light
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night
Blinded by the light

She got down but she never got tired
She's gonna make it through the night
She's gonna make it through the night


But mama, that's where the fun is
But mama, that's where the fun is
Mama always told me not to look into the eyes of the sun
But mama, that's where the fun is

Some brimstone, baritone, anticyclone, rolling stone
Preacher from the east
Says, "Dethrone the dictaphone, hit it in it's funny bone that's where they expect it least"
And some new-mown chaperone was standin' in the corner watchin' the young girls dance
And some fresh-sown moonstone was messin' with his frozen zone reminding him of romance
The calliope crashed to the ground!

But she was blinded by the light
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night
Blinded by the light
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night
