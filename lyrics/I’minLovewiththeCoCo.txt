I'm in love with the coco (love with the coco)
I got it for the low, low, low, low

Hit my plug, that's my cholo
He got it for the low, low
If you snitchin' I go loco (go crazy)
Hit you with that treinta ocho
If ya thinkin' that I’m solo
A 50 deep, I’m like, “oh, no”
I heard the feds takin' photos
Nothin’, not the popo

I’m in love with the coco (love with the coco)
I got it for the low, low, low, low, low
I’m in love with the coco (love with the coco)
I got it for the low, low, low, low, low
I’m in love, I-I’m in love with the coco

30 flicks, that’s a kilo
I need a brick, miss my three flow
I’m in love, just like Nino-no-no
Bustin' shots like Ne-Yo
Free my homies, not the C.O
And not the judge, not my P.O. no
All this sugar, I’m like Nino
Water whip, I’m like Nemo
See Ed Sheeran LiveGet tickets as low as $121You might also like[Bridge]
Bakin' soda, I got bakin' soda
Bakin' soda, I got bakin' soda
I whip it through the glass and
We’re going really fast, man

I’m in love with the coco (love with the coco)
I got it for the low, low, low, low, low
I’m in love with the coco (love with the coco)
I got it for the low, low, low, low, low
I’m in love, I-I’m in love with the coco

Low, low, low
Low, low, low
I got it for the low, man
Low, Low, Low
