I say if we're gonna do it, do it
Right

I remember when this all started, sex was carnage
This one's lasting, oh, oh
I was like, I was like cupid's calling, he's my darling
Things are gwanin, yeah (yeah)

The only thing on my mind, all the time, no appetite
Always wanna bite, just my type, this one's mine
And there's never been a human being so good for me, oh

I say if we're gonna do it, do it right (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
If we're gonna do this, do it right (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
If it's me and you, we gotta fight (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I say if we're gonna do it, do it right
We gotta do it, oh, we gotta do it right
If we're gonna do it, do it...

I remember when we went dancing, non-stop laughing
He's so charming, oh, oh
And we were like up 'til morning, heart's are pouring
And I adore him, yeah, yeah
