Today you hurt me
Gonna heal tomorrow
And if you leave me
I can do it solo

Today you hurt me
Gonna heal tomorrow
And if you leave me
I can do it solo

Today you hurt me
Gonna heal tomorrow
If you leave me
I can do it solo

Today you hurt me
Gonna heal tomorrow
And if you leave me
I can do it solo

I had a dream
It was melting like a sand castle in the wind
You couldn't focus
Riding way too hard
Just top keep the tonus

We surely fail
Had to share some
Blackmail back in jail
You could avoid us
Try always hard
Keeping us so jealous

Today you hurt me
Gonna heal tomorrow
If you leave me
I can do it solo

Today you hurt me
Gonna heal tomorrow
And if you leave me
I can do it solo

We've never asked
Why it's shuch a hard task
Talking off your mask
You're such a curious
Please try to keep it wise
Like a blooming lotus
He told me to
Had to think of what else now to do
You think it's obvious
But promise we're not born like a bunch of genious

Today you hurt me
Gonna heal tomorrow
If you leave me
I can do it solo

Today you hurt me
Gonna heal tomorrow
And if you leave me
I can do it solo

I have heard a lot
Digested it all
Know the world is smart
For sure i can fall

I have heard a lot
Digested it all
Know the world is smart
For sure i can fall
I have heard a lot
Digested it all
Know the world is smart
For sure i can fall

Gonna heal tomorrow
If you leave me
I can do it solo

Today you hurt me
Gonna heal tomorrow
And if you leave me
I can do it soloEmbed
