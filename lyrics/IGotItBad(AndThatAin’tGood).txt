No, that ain't good
My poor heart is sentimental, not made of wood
'Cause I've got it bad and that ain't good

And when the weekend's over and Monday rolls around
I end up like I start out just cryin' my heart out

Oh, oh, Lord above me, make him love me the way he should
The way he should
Because I've got it so bad and that ain't good
