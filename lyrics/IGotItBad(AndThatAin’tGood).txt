6 ContributorsI Got It Bad (And That Ainâ€™t Good) Lyrics[Verse]
My baby never treats me sweet and gentle the way he should
I got it bad and that ain't good
No, that ain't good
My poor heart is sentimental, not made of wood
'Cause I've got it bad and that ain't good

[Bridge]
And when the weekend's over and Monday rolls around
I end up like I start out just cryin' my heart out

[Outro]
Oh, oh, Lord above me, make him love me the way he should
The way he should
Because I've got it so bad and that ain't good
