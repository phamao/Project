DJ Khaled

Yeah, you're lookin' at the truth
The money never lies, no
I'm the one, yeah, I'm the one
Early mornin' in the Dawn
Know you wanna ride now (Let's ride, let's ride!)
I'm the one, yeah, I'm the one, yeah
And you sick of all those other imitators
Don't let the only real one intimidate ya
See you watchin', don't run outta time now
I'm the one, yeah

Oh-eh-oh-oh-oh, eh-oh
I'm the one
Oh-eh-oh-oh-oh, eh-oh
I'm the only one
Oh-eh-oh-oh-oh, eh-oh
I'm the one
Oh-eh-oh-oh-oh, eh-oh
I'm the only one
Yeah, yeah!

Quavo! I'm the one that hit that same spot (Hit it)
She is the one that brings them raindrops (Raindrops)
We go back, remember criss-cross and hopscotch? (Hopscotch)
You are the one that holds me down when the block's hot (Hot)
I make your dreams come true when you wake up (Dream)
And your look's just the same without any make-up (Bad)
Had to pull up on your mama, see what you made of (Mama)
Ain't gotta worry 'bout them commas 'cause my cake up (Cake)
You can run inside my life from that fame bus (Skrrt)
'Cause I promise, when we step out you'll be famous (Yeah)
Modern-day Bonnie and Clyde what they named us (Why?)
'Cause when we pull up—but-brt!—all angles

Okay though

Uh, she beat her face up with that new Chanel
She like the price, she sees the ice, and it makes her coochie melt
When I met her in the club I asked her who she felt
Then she went and put that booty on that Gucci belt
We don't have a label
She says she wants bottles, she ain't got no table
She doesn't have a bed frame, she doesn't get any tables
We just watchin' Netflix, she ain't got no cable, okay though
Plug, plug, plug, I'm the plug for her
She wants a nigga that pulls her hair and holds the door for her
Mmm, baby, that's only me, bitch, it okay with me
Baby, okay, okay though

Yeah, you're lookin' at the truth

Looking for the one?
Well, bitch, you're lookin' at the one
I'm the best yet, and my best is yet to come
'Cause I've been lookin' for somebody
Not just any fuckin' body
Don't make me catch a body
That's for any and everybody
Oh my God, she hit me up all day but got no response
Bitch, you blow my high
That's like turnin' gold to bronze, roll my eyes
And when she is on the molly, she is a zombie
She thinks Clyde and Bonnie
But it's more like Whitney and Bobby
God, forgive me! Tunechi F finessin', I'm a legend
Straight up out the Crescent
Fly your bae down for the Essence
For the record, I knew Khaled when that boy was spinnin' records
Mula Gang, winnin' record
I'm just flexin' on my exes, oh God

Yeah, you're lookin' at the truth
The money never lies, no
I'm the one, yeah, I'm the one
Early mornin' in the Dawn
Know you wanna ride now (Let's ride, let's ride!)
