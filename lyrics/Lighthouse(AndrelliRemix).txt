Looking back when we were younger
Sneaking out to feed the hunger
Oh, nobody knows

[Verse 2]
Getting caught behind the station
Remember that policeman chased us
Oh, nobody knows

[Pre-Chorus]
We have come so far
We can't turn back now
Let me walk you down this road

[Chorus]
Follow me, follow me when its dark out
I will be, I will be your lighthouse
And if you're lost, ohhh
I'll lead you back home
Follow me, follow me

[Verse 3]
There was a time you told me secrets
But you were scared I wouldn't keep them
Oh, but nobody knows
You might also like[Verse 4]
We used to smoke and watch the airplanes
Making-out as the ground shake
Oh, still nobody knows

[Pre-Chorus]
We have come so far
We can't turn back now
Let me walk you down this road

[Chorus]
Follow me, follow me when its dark out
I will be, I will be your lighthouse
And if you're lost, ohhh
I'll lead you back home
Follow me, follow me

Follow me, follow me when its dark out
I will be, I will be...

Follow me, follow me when its dark out
I will be, i will be your lighthouse
And if you're lost, ohhh
I'll lead you back home
Follow me, follow me
Follow me, follow me
Follow me, follow me7Embed
