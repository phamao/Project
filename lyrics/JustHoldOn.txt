107 ContributorsJust Hold On Lyrics[Verse 1: Louis Tomlinson]
Wish that you could build a time machine
So you could see
The things no one can see
Feels like you're standing on the edge
Looking at the stars
And wishing you were them

[Pre-Chorus: Louis Tomlinson]
‪What do you do when a chapter ends?‬
‪Do you close the book and never read it again?‬
‪Where do you go when your story's done?‬
‪You can be who you were or who you'll become‬
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh oh, if it all goes wrong‬
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh oh, darling, just hold on‬

[Chorus: Louis Tomlinson]
‪The sun goes down and it comes back up‬
‪The world it turns no matter what‬
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh oh, if it all goes wrong
Darling, just hold on

[Post-Chorus: Louis Tomlinson]
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh oh, darling, just hold on
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh oh

It's not over 'til it's all been said‬
‪It's not over 'til your dying breath‬
‪So what do you want them to say when you're gone?‬
‪That you gave up or that you kept going on?‬

[Pre-Chorus: Louis Tomlinson]
‪What do you do when a chapter ends?‬
‪Do you close the book and never read it again?‬
‪Where do you go when your story's done?‬
‪You can be who you were or who you'll become‬
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh oh, ‪if it all goes wrong‬
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh oh, darling, just hold on‬

[Chorus: Louis Tomlinson]
‪The sun goes down and it comes back up‬
‪The world it turns no matter what‬
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh oh, if it all goes wrong
Darling, just hold on

[Post-Chorus: Louis Tomlinson]
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh oh
Darling, just hold on
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh oh
If it all goes wrong
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh oh
Darling, just hold on
[Outro: Louis Tomlinson]
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh oh
If it all goes wrong, darling, just hold on48Embed
