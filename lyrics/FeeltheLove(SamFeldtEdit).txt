But I won't let you down
Long nights chasing the stars
'Til the sunrise, out of the blue
Under blue skies
I saw the shape of my heart

Every time I hear the music play
Every time I hear you say my name
When the air is filled with summer rain
I could feel the love, I could feel the love
I could feel the love, oh
I could feel the love, I could feel the love
I could feel the love

Every time I hear the music play
Every time I hear you say my name
When the air is filled with summer rain
I could feel the love, I could feel the love
I could feel the love, oh
I could feel the love, I could feel the love

Every time I hear you say my name
When the air is filled with summer rain
I could feel the love, I could feel the love
I could feel the love
I could feel the love, I could feel the love
I could feel the love, I could feel the loveEmbed
