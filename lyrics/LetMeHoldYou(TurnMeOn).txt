25 ContributorsLet Me Hold You (Turn Me On) Lyrics[Verse 1]
For the longest time we jamming at the party
And you're whipping on beat
Pushing everything on me
We got Silent√≥ on repeat
But if you think you're gonna get away from me
Better change your mind
The Henny got me feeling right
You're going home with me tonight

[Chorus]
Let me hold you, girl, caress my body
You got me going crazy
You turn me on, turn me on
Let me jam you, girl whip all around me
You got me going crazy
You turn me on, turn me on

[Post-Chorus]
Turn me on, turn me on
Turn me on, turn me on

[Verse 2]
For the longest time, you're staring like you want me
I can feel your eyes
So go tell your friends goodbye
We can make our way outside
If they think they're gonna stop you coming with me
Better change their minds
The Henny got us feeling right
You're going home with me tonight
You might also like[Chorus]
Let me hold you, girl, caress my body
You got me going crazy
You turn me on, turn me on
Let me jam you, girl whip all around me
You got me going crazy
You turn me on, turn me on

[Post-Chorus]
(Yeah)
Turn me on, turn me on
(Turn me on now)
Turn me on

[Chorus]
Let me hold you, girl, caress my body
You got me going crazy
You turn me on, turn me on
Let me jam you, girl whip all around me
You got me going crazy
You turn me on, turn me on

[Outro]
(Turn me on now)
Turn me on, turn me on
Yeah
