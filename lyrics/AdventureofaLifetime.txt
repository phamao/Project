We are legends, every day"
That's what she told me
"Turn your magic on," to me, she'd say
"Everythin' you want's a dream away
Under this pressure, under this weight
We are diamonds"

Now, I feel my heart beatin'
I feel my heart underneath my skin
Now, I feel my heart beatin'
Oh, you make me feel

Like I'm alive again
(Alive again)
Oh, you make me feel
Like I'm alive again

Said, "I can't go on, not in this way
I'm a dream that died by light of day
Gonna hold up half the sky and say
Only I own me"

Now, I feel my heart beatin'
I feel my heart underneath my skin
Oh, I can I feel my heart beatin'
'Cause you make me feel

Like I'm alive again
(Alive again)
Oh, you make me feel
Like I'm alive again

"Turn your magic on," Umi, she'd say
"Everythin' you want's a dream away
Under this pressure, under this weight
We are diamonds takin' shape
We are diamonds takin' shape"

(Woo, woo-hoo)
(Woo, woo-hoo)
If we've only got this life, this adventure, oh, then I
And if we've only got this life, you'll get me through alive
And if we've only got this life, in this adventure, oh, then I
Want to share it with you, with you, with you
Oh, see, yeah, see, yeah, I do
