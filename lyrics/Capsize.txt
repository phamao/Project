[Intro: Emily Warren]
Hey-ey-ey-ey-yeah
Hey-ya, hey-ya, hey
Hey-ey-ey-ey-yeah
Hey-ya, hey-ya, hey

[Verse 1: James Sunderland with Emily Warren]
Up at night I'm awake ‘cause it haunts me
That I never got to say what I wanted
Oh my God, oh my God
I’m not the same as I was with you
I would jump out my skin just to get you
Oh my God, oh my God

[Pre-Chorus: James Sunderland]
How could you have ever known if I never let it show
Now I just wanna know, are you...
[Chorus: Emily Warren]
Yeah, I'm fine
Drop tears in the morning
Give in to the lonely
Here it comes with no warning
Capsize, I'm first in the water
Too close to the bottom
I'm right back where I started
Said I'm fine
You might also like[Post-Chorus: Emily Warren]
Hey-ey-ey-ey-yeah
Hey-ya, hey-ya, hey
Hey-ey-ey-ey-yeah
Hey-ya, hey-ya, hey

[Verse 2: James Sunderland with Emily Warren]
Your silhouette is burned in my memory
Rubble left from the moment that you left me
Oh my God, oh my God
And three words have never come easy
‘Cause you're more than they ever could be
Oh my God, oh my God

[Pre-Chorus: James Sunderland]
How could you have ever known if I never let it show
Now I just wanna know, are you...

[Chorus: Emily Warren]
Yeah, I'm fine
Drop tears in the morning
Give in to the lonely
Here it comes with no warning
Capsize, I'm first in the water
Too close to the bottom
I'm right back where I started
Said I'm fine
[Post Chorus: Emily Warren]
Hey-ey-ey-ey-yeah
Hey-ya, hey-ya, hey
Hey-ey-ey-ey-yeah
Hey-ya, hey-ya, hey

[Bridge: Emily Warren]
I'm swimming up against the tide
Oh my god
I'm swimming but I'm getting tired
Oh my god
I'm swimming up against the tide
Oh my god
I'm swimming but I'm getting tired
Oh my god

[Chorus: Emily Warren]
Yeah, I'm fine
Drop tears in the morning
Give in to the lonely
Here it comes with no warning (no warning)
Capsize, I'm first in the water
Too close to the bottom
I'm right back where I started
Said I'm fine (fine)
[Post-Chorus: Emily Warren]
Hey-ey-ey-ey-yeah
Hey-ya, hey-ya, hey (Said I'm fine)
Hey-ey-ey-ey-yeah
Hey-ya, hey-ya, hey

[Outro]
