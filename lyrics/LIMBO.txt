Mm-mm-mm-mm
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
At the house of a dead man
Mm-mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm-mm-mm

The wind blows through the window
At the house of a dead man
All alone, in limbo holdin' onto a cold hand

Missin' a part of me, I know I need to shut my eyes again
I know it's hard to be the only one alone inside your head
Missin' a part of me, I know I need to shut my eyes again
I know it's hard to be the only one alone

The wind blows through the window at the house of a dead man
All alone, in limbo, holdin' onto a cold hand
The wind blows through the window at the house of a dead man
All alone, in limbo, holdin' onto a cold hand

Drownin' in all my regrets
All just the same in the end
Over and over again (Again)
All that we do is pretend (All that we do is pretend)
Drownin' in all my regrets
All just the same in the end (Just the same)
Over and over again
All that we do is pretend

Lay me down, I'll start again
You're not around, I can't pretend
That I won't drown, that life won't end
I'm bleedin' out, I lost a friend
Lay me down, I'll start again (Again)
You're not around, I can't pretend (Pretend)
That I won't drown, that life won't end
I'm bleedin' out, I lost a friend

The wind blows through the window at the house of a dead man
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
All alone, in limbo, holdin' onto a cold hand
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
