7 ContributorsWhat Do You Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
Spend your days on a 9 to 5
You waste your time on a central line
What do you love?
Work two jobs tryna stay alive
You spend your money on a Friday night
Tell me, what do you love?

[Pre-Chorus]
Just stand for something
Or fall for anything

[Chorus]
Come out of the dark, into the light
Whatever your fear is, it will be alright
But tell me, what do you love?
Tell me, what do you love?
Come out of the dark, into the light
Whatever your fear is, it will be alright
But tell me, what do you love?
Tell me, what do you love?
Come out of the dark, into the light
Whatever your fear is, it will be alright
But tell me, what do you love?
Tell me, what do you love?
Come out of the dark, into the light
Whatever your fear is, it will be alright
But tell me, what do you love?
Tell me, what do you love?
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
Tell me, what do you love? What do you love?
What do you, what do you, what do, what do you love?
Tell me, what do you love? What do you love?
What do you, what do you, what do, what do you love?

[Verse 2]
Work all day and you cry all night
You ain't loving life, you say your hands are tied
Oh, what do you love?
Sold your dreams for a sleepless night
Times are hard and you had to fight
What do you love?

[Pre-Chorus]
Just stand for something
Or fall for anything

[Chorus]
Come out of the dark, into the light
Whatever your fear is, it will be alright
But tell me, what do you love?
Tell me, what do you love?
Come out of the dark, into the light
Whatever your fear is, it will be alright
But tell me, what do you love?
Tell me, what do you love?
What do you love
[Post-Chorus]
Tell me, what do you love? What do you love?
What do you, what do you, what do, what do you love?
Tell me, what do you love? What do you love?
What do you, what do you, what do, what do you love?

[Chorus]
Come out of the dark, into the light
Whatever your fear is, it will be alright
But tell me, what do you love?
(What do you love? What do you love?
What do you, what do you, what do, what do you love?)
Come out of the dark, into the light
Whatever your fear is, it will be alright
But tell me, what do you love?
Come out of the dark, into the light
Whatever your fear is, it will be alright
But tell me, what do you love?
(What do you love? What do you love?
What do you, what do you, what do, what do you love?)
Come out of the dark, into the light
Whatever your fear is, it will be alright
But tell me, what do you love?
What do you love?Embed
