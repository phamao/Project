Watching the clouds float by
Wondering why the pain never deserted me
The sadness, sorrow, bewilderedness that never left

I'm flying away
I'm flying away

Holding hands with myself
Sharing life with myself
Reaping the loneliness I've sown
In these fields I've always grown
Digging the blackness from my mind
I will die all aloneYou might also like
