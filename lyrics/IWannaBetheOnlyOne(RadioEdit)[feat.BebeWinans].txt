BeBe: Let's go for it? Alright why don't you take the first verse
Easther: O.K
BeBe: Here we go

Easther: Yes I see you cryin'
(Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
And I feel your broken heart
(Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
I can feel you're hurting
(Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Still you choose to play the part
If you let me be
(If you let me be)
I'll be all you need, all you need

Both: I wanna be the only one to hold you
(Protect you from the rain)
I wanna be the only one to soothe you
(Erase all the pain)
I wanna be the only one to love you, love you
(Over again)
I wanna be the only one, the only one
(Only one I am)

I'll be worth the chance, worth the chance

(Erase all the pain)
I wanna be the only one to love you, love you
