Help me, it's like the walls are cavin' in
Sometimes, I feel like givin' up
But I just can't
It isn't in my blood

Layin' on the bathroom floor, feelin' nothin'
I'm overwhelmed and insecure, give me somethin'
I could take to ease my mind slowly
Just have a drink and you'll feel better
Just take her home and you'll feel better
Keep tellin' me that it gets better
Does it ever?

Help me
It's like the walls are cavin' in
Sometimes, I feel like givin' up
No medicine is strong enough
Someone help me
I'm crawlin' in my skin
Sometimes, I feel like givin' up
But I just can't

It isn't in my blood
It isn't in my blood

I'm lookin' through my phone again, feelin' anxious
Afraid to be alone again, I hate this
I'm tryin' to find a way to chill, can't breathe, oh
Is there somebody who could help me?

It's like the walls are cavin' in
Sometimes, I feel like givin' up
No medicine is strong enough
Someone help me
I'm crawlin' in my skin
Sometimes, I feel like givin' up
But I just can't

It isn't in my blood
It isn't in my blood (Ey)

I need somebody now
I need somebody now
Someone to help me out
I need somebody now

Help me, it's like the walls are cavin' in
Sometimes, I feel like givin' up
But I just can't
It isn't in my blood (Ooh-ooh)
It isn't in my blood, ohh (Ooh, ooh)

It isn't in my blood (Ooh-ooh)
I need somebody now (Ooh-ooh)
It isn't in my blood (Ooh-ooh)
I need somebody now
It isn't in my blood
