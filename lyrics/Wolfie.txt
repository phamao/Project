Where is he?
Have you got one?
I've got a ladybug
Have you got a ladybug?
I'm so sad fudge
I'm so sad fudge

Another drink down this sorrow
Walking 'round in your new clothes

I'll stay, I'll stay (I'll stay)
To find what you're needing (needing)
And I'll stay, I'll stay (I'll stay)
Watching you breathing (breathing)

Fall into my open arms
Dreaming of what you've become
All that I can do is love
Wait for you to come undone

I'll stay, I'll stay
Watching you breathing
I'll stay, I'll stay
Watching you breathing

Forever and ever
And ever, and ever
And ever
Forever and ever
And ever, and ever
And ever

Lights move in your eyes
Trying to see
Who you're going and what you want to be
Shapes in the suns keep going round
You're never alone, no you're never alone

I'll stay, I'll stay (I'll stay)
To find what you're needing (needing)
And I'll stay, I'll stay (I'll stay)
Watching you breathing (breathing)

Fall into my open arms
Dreaming of what you've become
All that I can do is love
Wait for you to come undone
I'll stay, I'll stay
Watching you breathing
I'll stay, I'll stay
Watching you breathing (breathing)

Say "Good morning everyone."
Good morning everyone
Have a lovely Saturday
Have a lovely SaturdayEmbed
