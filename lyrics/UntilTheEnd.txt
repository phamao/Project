Wherever you are
(wherever you are)
Wherever you are

I'll follow you until the end
I'll follow you until the end
Wherever you are
I'll follow you until the end

If ever you're lost and you need me
I'll chase you on my skin
If ever you're falling and lonesome
You'll hear me on the wind
Wherever you are
(wherever you are)
Wherever you are

If ever you're lost and you need me
I'll chase you on my skin
If ever you're falling and lonesome
You'll hear me on the wind
Wherever you are
(wherever you are)
Wherever you are
