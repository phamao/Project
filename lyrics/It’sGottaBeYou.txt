I hear a million voices in my head
Telling me the things I should have said
I don't know why I let you go
Oh I learned the hard way
Tell me it's not too late

Now my arms are open wide
They're hanging forever, there
Waiting forever, for you
I won't give up on you this time
Cause I ain't holding up, for nobody else

It's gotta be you
When you walked away my
Heart tried to replace ya
With someone like you
But I could never find it
I don't want to fight it
It's gotta be you

I wish I could turn back the time
The power is yours and never mine
Maybe with time you'll see that
I can give you all the things you missed
Oh no no
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Now my arms are open wide
And I ain't holding now, for nobody else

It's gotta be you
When you walked away
My heart tried to replace ya
With someone like you
But I could never find it
I don't want to fight it
It's gotta be you

You don't have to answer right now
Baby go and take your time
Cause I'll be here
It's gotta be you
It's gotta be you

It's gotta be you
When you walked away my
Heart tried to replace ya
With someone like you
But I can never find it
I don't want to fight it
It's gotta be you
It's gotta be you
I don't want nobody else
Nobody else but you
You, oh woah
It's gotta be you
