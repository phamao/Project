[Intro]
Let me introduce you
To one of the most talented men I know
My friend, the genius
Wyclef Jean!

I wanna see you dance, yeah!

Here we go!
Put your hands in the air!
Put your hands in the air!
Here we go
¡Uno, dos, tres, cuatro!
Put your hands in the air!
Put your hands in the air!
Put your hands in the air!
Hey
Shakira, Shakira

[Pre-Chorus: Wyclef Jean & Shakira]
I never really knew that she could dance like this (Hey)
She make a man wanna speak Spanish
¿Cómo se llama? (¡Sí!), ¿bonita? (¡Sí!)
Shakira, Shakira
Oh, baby, when you talk like that (Oh!)
You make a woman go mad (Come on!)
So be wise (¡Sí!), and keep on (¡Sí!)
Reading the signs of my body (Put your hands up!)
You might also like[Chorus: Shakira & Wyclef Jean]
I'm on tonight
You know my hips don’t lie
And I'm starting to feel you, boy (Come on!)
Come on, let's go (Sí!)
Real slow (Sí!)
Don’t you see, baby? This is perfection

[Verse 1: Wyclef Jean]
Hey, girl, I can see your body moving
And it's driving me crazy
And I didn't have the slightest idea
Until I saw you dancing
And when you walk up on the dance floor, nobody cannot ignore
The way you move your body, girl
And everything's so unexpected, the way you right and left it
So you can keep on shakin' it

[Pre-Chorus: Wyclef Jean & Shakira]
I never really knew that she could dance like this (Hey)
She make a man wanna speak Spanish
¿Cómo se llama? (¡Sí!), ¿bonita? (¡Sí!)
Mi casa
Shakira, Shakira
Oh, baby, when you talk like that (Oh!)
You make a woman go mad (Oh!)
So be wise (¡Sí!), and keep on (¡Sí!)
Reading the signs of my body (Wave your hands like this!)
[Chorus: Shakira & Wyclef Jean]
I'm on tonight
You know my hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel you, boy
Come on, let’s go (¡Sí!)
Real slow (¡Sí!)
Don’t you see, baby? This is perfection
They know I'm on tonight
My hips don’t lie and I'm starting to feel it's right
All the attraction (¡Sí!)
The tension (¡Sí!)
Don't you see, baby? This is perfection

[Verse 2: Shakira]
Oh, boy, I can see your body movin’, half-animal, half-man
I don't, don't really know what I'm doin'
But you seem to have a plan
My will and self-restraint have come to fail now, fail now
See, I'm doing what I can, but I can't, so, you know
That's a bit too hard to explain

[Bridge: Wyclef Jean with Shakira]
Baila en la calle de noche
Baila en la calle de día (Let's go!)
Baila en la calle de noche
Baila en la calle de día
[Pre-Chorus: Wyclef Jean & Shakira]
I never really knew that she could dance like this (Hey)
She make a man wanna speak Spanish
¿Cómo se llama? (¡Sí!), ¿bonita? (¡Sí!)
Shakira, Shakira
Oh, baby, when you talk like that (Oh!)
You know you got me hypnotized (Oh!)
So be wise (¡Sí), and keep on (¡Sí!)
Readin' the signs of my body

[Refrain: Wyclef Jean & Shakira]
Señorita, feel the conga
Let me see you move like you come from Colombia
Mira, en Barranquilla se baila así, say it!
En Barranquilla se baila así
¡Barranquillero'!

[Verse 3: Wyclef Jean with Shakira]
Yeah, she's so sexy, every man's fantasy
A refugee like me back with the Fugees from a third world country
I go back like when 'Pac carried crates for Humpty Humpty
We leave the whole club dizzy
Why the CIA wanna watch us?
It's the Colombians and Haitians
I ain't guilty, it's a musical transaction
Bo-bop-so-bop, no more do we snatch ropes
Refugees run the seas, 'cause we own our own boats

[Chorus: Shakira & Wyclef Jean]
I'm on tonight
My hips don't lie, and I'm starting to feel you, boy
Come on, let's go (Si!)
Real slow (Si!)
Baby, like this is perfection
They know I'm on tonight (Come on!)
My hips don't lie, and I'm starting to feel it's right
All the attraction,(Si!)
The tension(Si!)
Baby, like this is perfection

[Refrain]
I'm on tonight, come on!
Everybody, jump! Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!
I'm on tonight, go!
Sean Pauñ, happy birthday! Let's go!!
Come on, come on!
I'm on tonight
Everybody, jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!
I'm on tonight
Go Shaki, go Shaki, go!
I'm on tonight
If you from Miami, put your hands in the air!
I'm on tonight
I'm on tonight
Go Shaki, go Shaki, go!
I'm on tonight
¡Cumbia de mi tierra!
Come on!
Put your hands in the air! Come on!
I'm on tonight

[Chorus: Shakira & Wyclef Jean]
I'm on tonight
You know my hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel you, boy (Come on!)
Come on, let's go, (¡Sí!)
Real slow (Put your hands up!)
Don't you see, baby? This is perfection (Put your hands up!)
They know I'm on tonight
You know my hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel it's right (Come on!)
All the attraction (¡Sí!)
The tension (¡Sí!)
Don't you see, baby? This is perfection

No fighting tonight!

No fighting, right, people?
