Starin' at two different views
On your window ledge
Coffee has gone cold
It's like time froze

[Pre-Chorus]
There you go wishin', floatin' down our wishin' well
It's like I'm always causin' problems, causin' hell
I didn't mean to put you through this, I can tell
We cannot sweep this under the carpet (Carpet)

[Chorus]
I hope that I can turn back the time
To make it all alright, all alright for us
I'll promise to build a new world
For us two with you in the middle

[Instrumental Drop]

[Post-Drop]
(You in the middle)
(You in the middle)

[Verse 2]
(Ly-, ly-, ly-, ly-)
Lyin' down beside you
What's goin' through your head?
The silence in the air
Felt like my soul froze

Am I just overthinkin' feelings I conceal?
This gut feelin' I'm tryna get off me as well
I hope we find our missin' pieces and just chill
We cannot sweep it under the carpet (Carpet)

[Chorus]
I hope that I can turn back the time
To make it all alright, all alright for us
I'll promise to build a new world
For us two with you in the middle

[Outro]
(You)
站在中間, go stand 在中間
(You)
站在中間, go stand 在中間59Embed
