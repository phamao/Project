Never will it leave
Each day, it is retrieved
Seems like yesterday
Your eyes crept this way
Into my soul, you stared
And brought down every fear

We built our own house, own house
With our hands over our hearts
And we swore, on that day
That it'll never fall apart
We built our own house, own house
With our hands over our hearts
And we swore, on that day
That it'll never fall apart

We'll never fall apart
We'll never fall apart
With our hands over our hearts
We'll never fall apart

Wake up to the sun
Clouds always come undone
You give the light I need
Like water to a seed
Read it in a tale
One too tall to be real
And proved me wrong, it seems
A heart can truly gleam

We built our own house, own house
With our hands over our hearts
And we swore, on that day
That it'll never fall apart
We built our own house, own house
With our hands over our hearts
And we swore, on that day
That it'll never fall apart

We'll never fall apart
We'll never fall apart
With our hands over our hearts
We'll never fall apart
Take it all, take it away
We'll still have this undying
Love that is beating
'Til our lungs stop breathing
Take it all, take it away
We'll still have our riches
No need for stitches
'Cause love mends the pain
Take it all, take it away (love mends the pain)
So take it all, take it away (love mends the pain)
So take it all, take it away (love mends the pain)
So take it all, take it away
Take it all

We built our own house, own house
With our hands over our hearts
And we swore, on that day
That it'll never fall apart

We'll never fall apart
We'll never fall apart
With our hands over our hearts
We'll never fall apart
