Will you ever
Say you love me
Say you want me
Or whatever?
I have wondered
If you need me
It doesn't always
Seem like it

[Chorus 1]
But after all is fine
That you need this much time
It’s obvious what you think
I understand

[Verse 2]
Will you ever
Care about me
Ask about me
Talk whenever?
I've been waiting
Really struggling
Since forever
To make you smile
You might also like[Chorus 2]
But if you say goodbye
I won't be asking why
It’s obvious what you think
About us

[Post-Chorus]
I'm tired of everything
Let me know
Oh, do you feel the same?7Embed
