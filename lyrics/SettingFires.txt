Down to my last match fire
I'll touch just to feel
Why's it easier to burn than it is to heal?

[Pre-Chorus: XYLØ]
Out in the cold you have been
I've begged you to come back in
But I can't do this again

[Chorus: XYLØ]
I can't keep you from harm
But I'm set on fire to keep you warm
I can't go on and on
Setting fires to keep you warm
I can't keep you from harm
But I'm set on fire to keep you warm
I can't go on and on
Setting fires to keep you warm

[Post-Chorus: XYLØ]
I can't
I can't go on and on
Setting fires to keep you warm

[Verse 2: XYLØ]
I've been looking for answers
I don't want to hear
Chest to chest with you, I'm staring into a mirror
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: XYLØ]
Out in the cold you have been
I've begged you to come back in
But I can't do this again

[Chorus: XYLØ]
I can't keep you from harm
But I'm set on fire to keep you warm
I can't go on and on
Setting fires to keep you warm
I can't keep you from harm
But I'm set on fire to keep you warm
I can't go on and on
Setting fires to keep you warm

[Post-Chorus: XYLØ]
I can't
I can't go on and on
Setting fires to keep you warm

[Bridge: XYLØ]
What would I do
What wouldn't I do to save you
What would I do
What wouldn't I do to save you
[Chorus: XYLØ]
I can't keep you from harm
But I'm set on fire to keep you warm
I can't go on and on
Setting fires to keep you warm
I can't keep you from harm
But I'm set on fire to keep you warm
I can't go on and on
Setting fires to keep you warm

[Post-Chorus: XYLØ]
I can't
I can't
I can't go on and on
Setting fires to keep you warm
I can't
I can't
I can't go on and on
Setting fires to keep you warm19Embed
