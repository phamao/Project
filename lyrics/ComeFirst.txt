I got my own, don't need to buy me a drink
Stop asking questions like you care what I think
'Cause it's clear that you want me
But I come with a warning
So I'mma be real with you, I know what I need

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Ain't easy, you gotta earn it
Don't mind just watching you hurt it
Keep trying, practice makes perfect
(Oh, oh, oh)

[Chorus]
Baby, know that I come first, first, first
Baby, know that I come first, I come first, I come first
Baby, know that I come first, first, first
Baby, know that I come first, I come first, I come first

[Verse 2]
I got my own, don't need to roll me a blunt
Don't ask me questions like you care if I'm dumb (Oh?)
Take my treasure in your hands
Better get with the program
I'll let you stay if you do something I like
You might also like[Pre-Chorus 2]
I'm bossy, you can work for me
So sorry, yet I'm not sorry
I'mma work you into the morning

[Chorus]
Baby, know that I come first, first, first
Baby, know that I come first, I come first, I come first
Baby, know that I come first, first, first
Baby, know that I come first, I come first, I come first

[Bridge]
Keep me satisfied
I can make your head spin baby
Just look me in the face, ooh
I'mma show you what I like
No, it ain't about you
I gotta get me, myself, and mine

[Chorus]
Baby, know that I come first, first, first
Baby, know that I come first, I come first, I come first
Baby, know that I come first, first, first
Baby, know that I come first, I come first, I come first

[Outro]
Baby, know that I come first, I come first, I come first9Embed
