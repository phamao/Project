(Turn on another phillie, baby)

[Pre-Chorus: Ozuna & Bad Bunny, Arcángel]
Turn on another phillie, baby, this one's going out right now (Hey, yo')
Let's go for the fourth fuck, this is already a saga (Hahaha)
He says he likes to do it with my trap tunes (Oh, yeah)
And if they ask you for sex, I'm your fav

[Chorus: Bad Bunny & Ozuna, Both]
Tell 'em that I know your favorite poses
That I talk bad to you and that it turns you on
That I'll do everything you need to make you come
And tell them that I know your favorite poses
That I talk naughty to you and that turns you on
That I'll do everything you need to make you come

[Verse 1: Farruko]
(Farru!)
Tell him I'm the baby (Uh), your boyfriend's wearing Old Navy
I got flow, he ain't got flow
I'll hammer you and give you dembow (Haha)
At night, when he lеaves
You call me with the need
Causе you like the way I give it to you
Easy, ma', that's where I'm going now
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
I want to do little things to you that you've never had done (You've never had done)
Tonight with me you touch the ceiling (You touch the ceiling)
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
When you're fighting and you're in spite (spite)
You call me and I'll throw it inside (Hahaha)
You might also like[Verse 2: Arcángel]
Tell me if you want me to place you in my bed
Leave the drama, come on and mama
I'm gonna give you hard till morning (Wuh)
And let the action begin (The action; wuh-wuh)
Give me your location (Location)
You know I'm coming to you
And when I come, this bug causes excitement (Auh; wuh)
I lower him into the well like Poseidon (Yeah)
I spread his legs on the balcony (Auh)
To speak to you straight, ma', you put it in, motherfucker (Yeah)
I like the way you put the condom on me with your mouth (Uh)
And it looks better on you, mama, when he don't put nothin' on me
This bug is yours, go ahead and run
Come on and get on the tower (La Ma')

[Chorus: Bad Bunny & Ozuna]
Tell them that I know your favorite poses
That I talk bad to you and that it turns you on
That I do everything you need to make you come
And tell them that I know your favorite poses
That I talk naughty to you and that turns you on
That I do everything you need to make you come

[Verse 3: Ñengo Flow]
I know your poses
I make all your voices whisper down my neck
I light up the way when I crash your body next to mine
Making time stand still, this is the best moment
Pose down or up, pose on all fours, on top or on the side
Hot, hot, tell me what you feel
If I give it to you head on, it feels tight
Your ass stick it close to rumble all over you
Down and up in slow motion
[Verse 4: Bad Bunny & Farruko]
(Bad Bunny)
Let's do it inside the car and hit the hotel (hotel)
I feel like it, baby, and there's no time to waste
Crystal clear, no one's gonna see us
We're naughty and we wanna get in (Wuh)
You and me alone, come on, turn off your cell phone
I'm gonna do to you what he won't do to you
And woh, heh
The windows of the car fog up
Your little angel face deceives me
I'm healthy, but you're hurting me
And woh (Woh)
She turned on a krippy and she got all glowy
She gave me a blowjob while she was driving
She climbed up and seduced me

[Chorus: Farruko & Bad Bunny]
And tell him that I know your favorite pose
That I talk bad to you and that it turns you on
That I do everything you need to make you come (Farru'!)
And tell 'em (Tell 'em), that I know your favorite pose
That I talk bad to you and that it turns you on
That I'll do everything you need to make you come
