But now, I don't know if it is even worth fightin' for

Don't you know that there's nothin' here for you?
'Cause you've been gone for far too long
Didn't you listen when they all told you?
Don't you know, don't you know
That I've moved on?

'Cause I got sick and tired of always bein' used
Pushed me until I broke, left me with nothin' to lose
Yeah, you shattered my heart, made it broken and bruised
Then you'd apologize, say you didn't know what's gotten into you

But don't you know that there's nothin' here for you?
'Cause you've been gone for far too long
Didn't you listen when they all told you?
Don't you know, don't you know
That I've moved on?
You might also like[Chorus]
Don't you know that there's nothin' here for you?
'Cause you've been gone for far too long
Didn't you listen when they all told you?
But don't you know that there's nothin' here for you?
'Cause you've been gone for far too long
Didn't you listen when they all told you?
Don't you know, don't you know
Don't you know, don't you know
Don't you know, don't you know
That I've moved on?

I've moved onEmbed
