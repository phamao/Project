2 ContributorsDon’t You Know (Radio Edit) Lyrics[Verse 1]
We've been through this too many times before
And I've realized I don't wanna do it anymore
You're too easy to forgive, too hard to forget, I know
But now, I don't know if it is even worth fightin' for

[Chorus]
Don't you know that there's nothin' here for you?
'Cause you've been gone for far too long
Didn't you listen when they all told you?
Don't you know, don't you know
That I've moved on?

[Verse 2]
'Cause I got sick and tired of always bein' used
Pushed me until I broke, left me with nothin' to lose
Yeah, you shattered my heart, made it broken and bruised
Then you'd apologize, say you didn't know what's gotten into you

[Chorus]
But don't you know that there's nothin' here for you?
'Cause you've been gone for far too long
Didn't you listen when they all told you?
Don't you know, don't you know
That I've moved on?

Don't you know that there's nothin' here for you?
'Cause you've been gone for far too long
Didn't you listen when they all told you?
But don't you know that there's nothin' here for you?
'Cause you've been gone for far too long
Didn't you listen when they all told you?
Don't you know, don't you know
Don't you know, don't you know
Don't you know, don't you know
That I've moved on?

[Outro]
I've moved onEmbed
