I didn't know that I could want you so deep
As when I saw you with someone who's not me
You got me playin' in a game that ain't fair
But you're takin' me there
Ueah, you're takin' me there

(Oh) I can't help myself, it's human nature

(Oh) Why can't we be on our worst behavior?
Worst behavior
When it comes so naturally?

I would like to get to know you, baby
Like to get under your sexy body
I would like to get to know you, baby
Like to get under your sexy body
Woah, woah
Under your sexy body

(Oh)  Under your sexy body
(Oh)  Under your sexy body
