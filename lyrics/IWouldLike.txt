45 ContributorsI Would Like Lyrics[Verse 1]
I didn't know that I could want you so deep
As when I saw you with someone who's not me
You got me playin' in a game that ain't fair
But you're takin' me there
Ueah, you're takin' me there

[Pre-Chorus]
(Oh) I can't help myself, it's human nature
Human nature
Who's to say what's meant to be?
(Oh) Why can't we be on our worst behavior?
Worst behavior
When it comes so naturally?

[Chorus]
I would like to get to know you, baby
Like to get under your sexy body
I would like to get to know you, baby
Like to get under your sexy body
Woah, woah
Under your sexy body

[Post-Chorus]
(Oh)  Under your sexy body
(Oh)  Under your sexy body
