Lights up on Washington Heights, up at the break of day
I wake up and I got this little punk I gotta chase away
Pop the grate at the crack of dawn
Sing while I wipe down the awning
Hey y'all, good morning
Ice cold piragua! Parcha, china, cherry, strawberry, and just for today, I got mamey!
Oye, piragüero, ¿como estas?

Como siempre, Señor Usnavi.​

I am Usnavi and you prob'ly never heard my name
Reports of my fame are greatly exaggerated
Exacerbated by the fact that my syntax
Is highly complicated 'cause I immigrated
From the single greatest little place in the Caribbean
Dominican Republic, I love it!
Jesus, I'm jealous of it, and beyond that
Ever since my folks passed on, I haven't gone back
Goddamn, I gotta get on that
You might also like(spoken)
¡Fo!

(sung)
The milk has gone bad, hold up just a second
Why is everything in this fridge warm and tepid?
I better step it up and fight the heat
'Cause I'm not makin' any profit if the coffee isn't light and sweet!

Ooh!

Abuela, my fridge broke. I got café but no "con leche."

Try my mother's old recipe: one can of condensed milk.

Nice.​


¡Ay! Paciencia y fe…
That was Abuela, she's not really my abuela
But she practically raised me, this corner is her escuela
Now, you're prob'ly thinkin', "I'm up shit's creek
I never been north of Ninety-Sixth Street”
Well, you must take the A Train
Even farther than Harlem to northern Manhattan and maintain
Get off at One Eighty-First and take the escalator
I hope you're writin' this down, I'm gonna test ya later
I'm getting tested, times are tough on this bodega
Two months ago, somebody bought Ortega's
Our neighbors started packin' up and pickin' up
And ever since the rents went up
It's gotten mad expensive, but we live with just enough

In the Heights, I flip the lights and start my day
There are fights

And endless debts

And bills to pay

In the Heights, I can't survive without café
I serve café

'Cause tonight seems like a million years away
En Washington—

Next up to bat, the Rosarios
They run the cab company,​ they struggle in the barrio
See, their daughter Nina's off at college, tuition is mad steep
So they can't sleep, everything they get is mad cheap
Good morning, Usnavi

Pan caliente, café con leche

Put twenty dollars on today's lottery

One ticket, that's it!

Hey! A man's gotta dream

Don't mind him, he's all excited
‘Cause Nina flew in at 3 a.m. last night

Don't look at me, this one's been cookin' all week
Usnavi, come over for dinner

There's plenty to eat
So then Yesenia walks in the room...

Ah-ha

She smells sex and cheap perfume

Uh-oh

It smells like one of those trees
That you hang from the rear view

Ha-ha, no!

It's true! She screams, “Who's in there with you, Julio?”
Grabs a bat and kicks in the door
He's in bed with José from the liquor store!

¡No me diga!

Daniela and Carla, from the salon.​

Thanks, Usnavi!

Sonny, you're late.​

Chillax! You know you love me.​

Me and my cousin runnin'
Just another dime-a-dozen mom-and-pop stop-and-shop
And, oh my god, it's gotten too darn hot
Like my man Cole Porter said
People come through for a few cold waters and
A lottery ticket, just a part of the routine
Everybody's got a job, everybody's got a dream
They gossip, as I sip my coffee and smirk
The first stop as people hop to work
Bust it— I'm like:
"One dollar, two dollars, one fifty, one sixty-nine
I got it, you want a box of condoms? What kind?
That's two quarters,​ two quarter waters
The New York Times
You need a bag for that? The tax is added"
Once you get some practice at it
You do rapid mathematics automatically
Sellin' maxi-pads, fuzzy dice for taxicabs
Practically everybody's stressed, yes
But they press through the mess
Bounce checks and wonder what's next

In the Heights
I buy my coffee and I go (I buy my coffee and—)
Set my sights
On only what I need to know (What I need to know)
In the Heights
Money is tight, but even so (But even so)
When the lights go down, I blast my radio

You ain't got no skills
Benny!
Yo, lemme get a—

Milky Way

Yeah, lemme also get a—

Daily News

And a—

Post

And most important, my—

Boss's second coffee, one cream—

Five sugars

I'm the number-one earner

What?!

The fastest learner

What?!

My boss can't keep me on the damn back burner

Yes, he can
I'm makin' moves, I'm makin' deals
But guess what?

What?

You still ain't got no skills

Hardee-har
Yo, Vanessa show up yet?

Shut up!

Hey little homie, don't get so upset

Man...

Tell Vanessa how you feel, buy the girl a meal
On the real, or you ain't got no skills


No! No, no, no!
No no no, no-no-no, no, no-no-no!
No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no, no-no-no-no-no!
Mr. Johnson, I got the security deposit
It's locked in a box in the bottom of my closet
It's not reflected in my bank statement
But I've been savin' to make a down payment and pay rent
No, no, I won't let you down

Yo, here's your chance, ask her out right now!

I'll see you later, we can look at that lease
Do somethin', make your move, don't freeze!
Hey!
You owe me a bottle of cold champagne

Are you moving?
Just a little credit check and I'm on that downtown train

Well, your coffee's on the house

Okay

Usnavi, ask her out

No way

I'll see you later, so…

Ooh, smooth operator, aw, damn, there she goes!
Yo, bro, take five, take a walk outside
You look exhausted, lost, don't let life slide
The whole hood is struggling, yeah, times are tight
And you're stuck to this corner like a streetlight
Yeah, I'm a streetlight, chokin' on the heat
The world spins around while I'm frozen to my seat
The people that I know all keep on rollin' down the street
But every day is different so I'm switchin' up the beat
'Cause my parents came with nothing, they got a little more
And sure, we're poor, but yo, at least we got the store
And it's all about the legacy they left with me, it's destiny
And one day I'll be on a beach with Sonny writin' checks to me

In the Heights, I hang my flag up on display

We came to work and to live and we got a lot in common

It reminds me that I came from miles away

D.R., P.R., we are not stoppin'

In the Heights

Every day, paciencia y fe

Until the day we go from poverty to stock options

In the Heights, I've got today

And today's all we got, so we cannot stop
This is our block

In the Heights, I hang my flag up on display

¡Lo le lo le lo lai lai lo le!

It reminds me that I came from miles away

My family came from miles away

In the Heights
It gets more expensive every day

Every day

And tonight is so far away

But as for mañana, mi pana
Ya gotta just keep watchin'

You'll see the late nights (In the Heights)
You'll taste ​beans and rice (In the Heights)
The syrups and ​shaved ice
I ain't gonna say it twice (In the Heights)
So turn up the stage lights (Ah)
We're takin' a flight
To a couple of days
​In the life of what it's like
¡En Washington Heights!
