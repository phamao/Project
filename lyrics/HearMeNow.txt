Your friends are faded, let me fill up your cup
And toast to the stars over

The ocean's foaming
Emotions in the air

I don't wanna live for nothing, just wanna be something
I never knew what it took to win
I don't wanna live for nothing, just wanna be something
I never knew we'd be more than friends

We spin the bottle till we're kissing our cups
Felt like I'd die for you
You can't explain it, it's been years since we've touched
And I've waited nine for you

I don't wanna live for nothing, just wanna be something
I never knew what it took to win
I don't wanna live for nothing, just wanna be something
I never knew we'd be more than friends

Come let me up
Can you hear me now?
I'm 'bout half a block away out
Can you hear me now?

The ocean's foaming
Emotions in the air

I don't wanna live for nothing, just wanna be something
I never knew what it took to win
I don't wanna live for nothing, just wanna be something
I never knew we'd be more than friends

Come let me up, can you hear me now?
Come let me up, I'm 'bout half a block away out
Come let me up, can you hear me now?
Come let me up, I'm 'bout half a block away out
Come let me up

Can you hear me now, come let me up
I'm 'bout half a block away out, come let me up
