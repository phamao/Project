I heard you done got you a dime piece, man
Hell naw, man, that nigga lyin', cuz
One of them Beyoncé, Meagan Good types, man
Nah, nah, nah
Is that true, man?
I just wanna know
Probably not
I mean, shit, to be honest with you, man, she's a...

Bad thang (Shit), fine as hell (Woo), thick as fuck
Oh my God (Damn), that's my baby
Caroline, you divine, mighty fine
Shawty really blow the pipe (That's true), like a pro
Aha, fuck you thought?

Holy shit, I'm really lit (It's lit)
It's lookin' like it's 'bout time (Shee), to fuck it up (Work)
Caroline, listen up, don't wanna hear
About your horoscope or what the future holds
Shut up and, shut up and
Let's get gory like a Tarantino movie
Don't wanna talk it out, can we fuck it out?
'Cause we gon' be up all night, fuck a decaf
You say I'm a tall thug, guess I'm a G-raffe
If you want safe sex, baby, use the knee pads
Freaky with the sticky-icky, baby, give me kitty, kitty
Mmm, killa, westside nigga (Ayy, ayy, goddamn)
Boy, you like 98 degrees and I'm 300
Nigga, keep your feet runnin' (Hot, hot)
I Chief-Keef-Keef when I eat these beats, bet a boy get scurred (Get scurred)
Don't run up in my lane, I don't want you in my lane
You a lame, get swerved

'Cause great scenes might be great
But I love your bloopers
And perfect's for the urgent
Baby, I want forever
And, Caroline, don't you see that
I want you to be my—

Bad thang (Woah, shit), fine as hell (Woo), thick as fuck
Oh my God (Damn), that's my baby (Woah, woah)
Caroline, you divine, mighty fine (Woah-oh-oh)
Shawty really blow the pipe (That's true), like a pro (Ah)
Aha (Wha-?)
