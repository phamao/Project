Sheesh, Yeah
Anything that you ever need
I'mma do it for you
If you ever need a place to stay
I'll get a roof for you
Baby one day, if I get the money
I can go and buy a coupe for you
Better yet, I'll get two for you
Matter fact, I'll get 3, 4, 5, 6, for you
Comin' through, with the 10 for you
Gettin' some things off my mind
What is you blind?
Dude that you're with, is just wastin' your time
You're somethin' special the type that deserves to be taken out
Not stay home with a guy that don't try
I'll get you steak, shrimp, and lobster
He'll get you Wendy's, a medium drink with some fries
Being a 10 won't you rather be spendin'
Your love and affection on more than a 5
Talkin' like oh no, oh no
He's so, so, so
If you keep actin' up
I'mma just sit back and let her take a L
Girl if you confused, I'mma let him break it down
Girl don't you know that with me it's the truest
It ain't that hard to say, ''Fuck it, let's do this''
Being with him yeah that's useless
Yeah, yeah
