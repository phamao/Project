I got these fresh eyes, never seen you before like this
My God, you're beautiful
It's like the first time when we opened the door
'Fore we got used to usual

[Pre-Chorus 1]
It might seem superficial
Stereotypical, man
You dress up just a little and I'm like, "Oh, damn"

[Chorus]
So suddenly, I'm in love with a stranger
I can't believe that she's mine
Now all I see is you with fresh eyes, fresh eyes
So suddenly, I'm in love with a stranger
I can't believe that she's mine, yeah
And now all I see is you with fresh eyes, fresh eyes

[Verse 2]
Appreciation, well, it comes and it goes
But I, I'll ride that wave with you
It's human nature to miss what's under your nose
'Til you, 'til you remind a fool

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Maybe all of this is simple
My heart's unconditional, yeah
You dress up just a little and I'm like, "Oh, damn"
You might also like[Chorus]
So suddenly, I'm in love with a stranger
I can't believe that she's mine
Now all I see is you with fresh eyes, fresh eyes
So suddenly, I'm in love with a stranger
I can't believe that she's mine, yeah
And now all I see is you with fresh eyes, fresh eyes

[Bridge]
If I could bottle this up, bottle, bottle this up, I would
I would bottle this up, bottle, bottle this up, I would
'Cause you're gorgeous in this moment
If I could bottle this up, I would

[Chorus]
So suddenly, I'm in love with a stranger
I can't believe that she's mine
Now all I see is you with fresh eyes, fresh eyes
So suddenly, I'm in love with a stranger
I can't believe that she's mine, yeah
And now all I see is you with fresh eyes, fresh eyes6Embed
