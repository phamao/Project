I don't know where this is coming from
How did we end up here?
It just feels so good with you
And you and I just add up to one
How did we end up here?
Oh, but it around my sun

Where did you come from?
Didn't see this coming
Got me floating now
I think I love ya, I really really love ya

Flying higher, higher than a UFO
Let's go let's go where the love is
Flying higher, higher than a UFO
Let's go, let's go, let's go
Flying higher, higher than a UFO
Let's go, let's go where the love is
Flying higher, higher than a UFO
Let's go, let's go, let's go

Your burning lips, your burning at my heart
How did we end up here?
Drowning in your eyes tonight
Time is flashing like a flashing star
How did we end up here?
I didn't know what I would find
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Where did you come from?
Didn't see this coming
Got me floating now
I think I love ya, I really really love ya

Flying higher, higher than a UFO
Let's go, let's go where the love is
Flying higher, higher than a UFO
Let's go, let's go, let's go
Flying higher, higher than a UFO
Let's go, let's go where the love is
Flying higher, higher than a UFO
Let's go, let's go, let's go


Flying higher, higher than a UFO
Let's go, let's go where the love is
Flying higher, higher than a UFO
Let's go, let's go, let's go (where the love is)
Flying higher, higher than a UFO
Let's go, let's go where the love is
Flying higher, higher than a UFO
Let's go, let's go, let's goEmbed
