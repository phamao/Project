Is it my imagination?
Is it something that I'm takin'?
All the smiles that I'm fakin'
"Everythin' is great, everythin' is fucking great"
Goin' out every weekend
Starin' at the stars on the ceiling
Hollywood friends, gotta see them
Such a good time, I believe it this time

Tuesday night, glazed over eyes
Just one more pint or five
Does it even matter anyway?

We're dancin' on tables
And I'm off my face
With all of my people
"And it couldn't get better," they say
We're singing till last call
And it's all out of tune
Should be laughing, but there's something wrong
And it hits me when the lights go on
Shit, maybe I miss you

Just like that and I'm sober
I'm asking myself, "Is it over?"
Maybe I was lying when I told ya
"Everythin' is great, everythin' is fucking great"
And all of these thoughts and the feelings
Cheers to that if you don't need them
I've been checking my phone all evenin'
Such a good time, I believe it this time

Tuesday night, glazed over eyes
Just one more pint or five
Does it even matter anyway?

We're dancin' on tables
And I'm off my face
With all of my people
"And it couldn't get better," they say
We're singing till last call
And it's all out of tune
Should be laughing, but there's something wrong
And it hits me when the lights go on
Shit, maybe I miss you
Now, I'm asking my friends how to say "I'm sorry"
They say, "Lad, give it time, there's no need to worry"
And we can't even be on the phone now
And I can't even be with you alone now
Oh, how shit changes
We were in love, now we're strangers
When I feel it comin' up, I just throw it all away
Get another two shots 'cause it doesn't matter anyway

We're dancin' on tables
And I'm off my face
With all of my people
"And it couldn't get better," they say
We're singing till last call
And it's all out of tune
Should be laughing, but there's something wrong
And it hits me when the lights go on
We're dancin' on tables
And I'm off my face
With all of my people
"And it couldn't get better," they say
We're singing till last call
And it's all out of tune
Should be laughing, but there's something wrong
And it hits me when the lights go on
Shit, maybe I miss you
