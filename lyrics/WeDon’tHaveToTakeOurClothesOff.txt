Not a word, from your lips
You just took for granted that I want to skinny dip, oh
A quick hit, that's your game
But I'm not a piece of meat, stimulate my brain, no
The night is young, so are we
Let's just get to know each other, slow and easily, oh
Take my hand, let's hit the floor
Shake our bodies to the music
Maybe then you'll score, mmm

So come on baby, won't you show some class?
Why do you have to move so fast?

We don't have to take our clothes off
To have a good time, oh no
And we could dance and party all night
And drink some cherry wine, oh-oh

Just slow down if you want me
A man wants to be approached cool and romantically, oh-oh
I've got needs, I'm just like you
If the conversation's good vibrations through and through, oh-ha
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
So come on baby, won't you show some class?
Why do you have to move so fast?

We don't have to take our clothes off
To have a good time, no oh
We could dance and party all night
And drink some cherry wine, oh-oh
And we don't have to take our clothes off, no
To have a good time, no oh
We could dance and party all night
And drink some cherry wine, oh-oh

Ay-ay-ay
Ay-ay-ay
Oh-ah
Ay-ay
Oh

We don't have to take our clothes off
To have a good time, oh-oh
And we could dance and party all night, oh
And drink some cherry wine, oh-oh
We don't have to take our clothes off, no
To have a good time, oh no
We could dance and party all night
And drink some cherry wine, oh-hmm
