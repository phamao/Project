When I was down, when I was hurt
You came to lift me up
Life is a drink and love's a drug
Oh, now I think I must be miles up
When I was a river dried up
You came to rain a flood

Oh-I-Oh-I-Oh-I
Got me feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
Oh-I-Oh-I-Oh-I
Now I'm feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
Feeling drunk and high
Feeling drunk and high
So high

Oh, angel sent from up above
I feel it coursing through my blood
Life is a drink, your love's about
To make the stars come out

Oh-I-Oh-I-Oh-I
Got me feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
Oh-I-Oh-I-Oh-I
Now I'm feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
Feeling drunk and high
Feeling drunk and high
So high
