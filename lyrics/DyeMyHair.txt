No bullets pierce my eyes shut

But there's something in the way I act around you
Tryna turn your head
Laugh at jokes that I don't get
There is something in the way I act around you
The way I feel about you
Not a thing I wouldn't do

I will dye my hair blonde for you
I will dye my hair blonde for you
You got that mad power, the sweet and sour
You won't cut me loose
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
I will dye my hair blonde for you
I will dye my hair blonde for you
You got that mad power, the sweet and sour
You won't cut me loose
There's nothing that I wouldn't do

Don't buy me fancy things
Don't buy me any drinks
I pay for my own sins, oh yeah
I was raised to be free
Got my independency
Why do I get so weak?

'Cause there's something in the way I act around you
Tryna turn your head
Laugh at jokes that I don't get
There is something in the way I act around you
The way I feel about you
Not a thing I wouldn't do

I will dye my hair blonde for you
I will dye my hair blonde for you
You got that mad power, the sweet and sour
You won't cut me loose
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
I will dye my hair blonde for you
I will dye my hair blonde for you
You got that mad power, the sweet and sour
You won't cut me loose
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
I will dye my hair blonde for you
I will dye my hair blonde for you
You got that mad power, the sweet and sour
So how could I refuse?
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
But there's something in the way I act around you
Around you, around you
But there's something in the way I act around you
The way I feel about you
Not a thing I wouldn't do

I will dye my hair blonde for you
I will dye my hair blonde for you
You got that mad power, the sweet and sour
You won't cut me loose
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
I will dye my hair blonde for you
I will dye my hair blonde for you
You got that mad power, the sweet and sour
So how could I refuse?
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
I will dye my hair blonde for you
