9 ContributorsWhat Is Love 2016 Lyrics[Verse 1]
Oh, I don't know why you're not there
I give you my love but you don't care
So what is right and what is wrong?
Give me a sign

[Chorus]
What is love?
Baby, don't hurt me
Baby, don't hurt me no more
What is love?
Baby, don't hurt me
Baby, don't hurt me no more
What is love?
Baby, don't hurt me
Baby, don't hurt me no more
What is love?
Baby, don't hurt me
Baby, don't hurt me no more

[Beat break]

[Verse 2]
Oh, I don't know why you're not there
I give you my love but you don't care
So what is right and what is wrong?
Give me a sign
