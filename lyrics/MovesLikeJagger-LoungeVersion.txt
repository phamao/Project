If you feel like
And take me away, make it okay
I swear I'll behave You wanted control
So we waited
I put on a show
Now I make it
You say I'm a kid
My ego is big
I don't give a sh*t
And it goes like this Take me by the tongue
And I'll know you
Kiss me till you're drunk
And I'll show you You want the moves like jagger
I've got the moves like jagger
I've got the mooooooves... like jagger I don't need to try to control you
Look into my eyes and I'll own you With them the moves like jagger
I've got the moves like jagger
I've got the mooooooves... like jagger Maybe it's hard
When you feel like you're broken and scarred
Nothing feels right
But when you're with me
I make you believe
That I've got the key So get in the car
We can ride it
Wherever you want
Get inside it
And you want to steer
But I'm shifting gears
I'll take it from here
And it goes like this Take me by the tongue
And I'll know you
Kiss me till you're drunk
And I'll show you You want the moves like jagger
I've got the moves like jagger
I've got the mooooooves... like jagger I don't need to try to control you
Look into my eyes and I'll own you With them the moves like jagger
I've got the moves like jagger
I've got the mooooooves... like jagger You wanna know how to make me smile
Take control, own me just for the night
And if I share my secret
You're gonna have to keep it
Nobody else can see this So watch and learn
I won't show you twice
Head to toe, ooh baby, roll me right
And if I share my secret
You're gonna have to keep it
Nobody else can see this And it goes like this Take me by the tongue
And I'll know you
Kiss me till you're drunk
And I'll show you You want the moves like jagger
I've got the moves like jagger
I've got the mooooooves... like jagger I don't need to try to control you
Look into my eyes and I'll own you With them the moves like jagger
