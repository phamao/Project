[Verse 1]
Nobody ever knows
Nobody ever sees
I left my soul
Back then, no I'm too weak

[Pre-Chorus]
Most nights I pray for you to come home
Praying to the lord
Praying for my soul

[Chorus]
Now please don't go
Most nights I hardly sleep when I'm alone
Now please don't go, oh no
I think of you whenever I'm alone
So please don't go

Cause I don't ever wanna know
Don't ever want to see things change
Cause when I'm living on my own
I wanna take it back and start again

[Pre-Chorus]
Most nights I pray for you to come home
I'm praying to the lord
I'm praying for my soul

[Chorus]
Now please don't go
Most nights I hardly sleep
When I'm alone
Now please don't go, oh no
I think of you whenever I'm alone
So please don't go

[Bridge]
I sent so many messages
You don't reply
Gotta figure out, what am I missing babe?
Singing now, oh oh oh
I need you now, I need your love, oh
[Chorus]
Now please don't go
I said most nights I hardly sleep
When I'm alone
Now please don't go, oh no
I think of you whenever I'm alone
So please don't, (please) don't go
So please (please) don't go
(Please) don't go, oh no
So please don't go
I think of you whenever I'm alone
So please don't go33Embed
