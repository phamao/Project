I hope that you don't think I'm rude
But I want to make out with you
And I'm a little awkward, sure
But I could touch my face to yours, oh
And no one ever called me smooth
But I just wanna see the grooves
Between your hands, your teeth, oh
Tell me, do you think about me?

[Pre-Chorus]
I just wanna kiss you
And even if I miss you
At least I'll know what it's like to have held your hand, oh!
No-o, hey!

[Chorus]
Bad ideas, ay (Oh)
I know where they lead (Hey, oh)
But I got too many to sleep
And I can't get enough, no
I wanna kiss you standing up
Oh-oh, no
And if tomorrow makes me low (No)
Well it'd be worth it just to know
'Cause I can't get enough, no
I wanna kiss you standing up
O-oh, hey
You might also like[Verse 2]
I don't know what compels me
To do the very thing that fells me
I wake up, still high on you
But by the night, I'm crashing through, so

[Pre-Chorus]
Why I'd wanna kiss you
Even though I miss you
Guess I just want to know what it would feel like, oh!
No-o, hey

[Chorus]
Bad ideas, ay (Oh)
I know where they lead (Hey, oh)
But I got too many to sleep
And I can't get enough, no
I wanna kiss you standing up
O-oh, no
And if tomorrow makes me low (No)
Well it'd be worth it just to know
'Cause I can't get enough, no
I wanna kiss you standing up
O-oh

[Bridge]
Smitten's a bad look on me
And if I'm talking honestly
It takes everything I got not to text, and
I just want a kiss to get me through
'Cause now all my bed-sheets smell like you, so
[Pre-Chorus]
If you think you miss me
Come on back and kiss me
I just gotta know what you and I would feel like, oh!
No, hey
Yikes

[Chorus]
Bad ideas, ay (Oh)
I know where they lead (Hey, oh)
But I got too many to sleep
And I can't get enough, no
I wanna kiss you standing up
Oh-oh, no
And if tomorrow makes me low (No)
Well it'd be worth it just to know
'Cause I can't get enough, no-o
I wanna kiss you standing up
Oh-oh8Embed
