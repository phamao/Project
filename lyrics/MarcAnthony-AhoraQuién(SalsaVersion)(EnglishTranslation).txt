Who are you going to say "I love you" to now?
And later in silence, you'll give them your body
You'll stop the time on the pillow
A thousand hours will pass in your gaze
Life will only exist as long as they love you
Now who?

And who will write you poems and letters?
And who will tell you their fears and faults?
Who will you let sleep on your back?
And later in the silence, you'll tell them, "I love you"
They'll stop their breath over your face
And they'll forget their drift in your gaze and
They'll forget about their life while loving you
Now who?

Oh
Now who, if it's not me?
I look at myself in the mirror and I cry
And I feel stupid, illogical
And later I imagine you gifting the scent of your skin
Your kisses, your eternal smile, and even soul in a kiss
A kiss that goes to the soul
And in my soul is the kiss that could've been
Now who, if it's not me?
I look at myself in the mirror and I cry
And I feel stupid, illogical
And later I imagine you gifting the scent of your skin
Your kisses, your eternal smile, and even soul in a kiss
A kiss that goes to the soul
And in my soul is the kiss that could've been
Oh, who now?

Who will you leave your scent to in bed?
Who will remember the memory tomorrow?
Who's hours will pass by calmly?
And later in silence will desire your body
The time will stop before them
A thousand hours will pass as they stand by their window
And they'll lose their voice calling for you

Now who?
Now Who?

Oh
Now who, if it's not me?
I look at myself in the mirror and I cry
And I feel stupid, illogical
And later I imagine you gifting the scent of your skin
Your kisses, your eternal smile, and even soul in a kiss
A kiss that goes to the soul
And in my soul is the kiss that could've been
(Now who?)
(I cry and I feel stupid)
(Now who?)
Who'll be the one to kiss you?
And will give you a thousand caresses?
(Now who?)
(I cry and I feel stupid)
(Now who?)
My only intent was to love you
Who will have the honour of adoring you?
(Now who?)
(I cry and I feel stupid)
Now who?
(Now who?)
Tell me, who will write you poems and letters
And will tell you about their fears and faults?
(Now who?)
(I cry and I feel stupid)
(Now who?)
I'm suffering, I miss you
Oh, for you, beautiful girl, I cry, mom
I cry, mom
I'm alone, mom
I'm dying, mom
(Sergio!)
(Woah!)
(Chichi!)
Now who, if it's not me?
I look at myself in the mirror and I cry
And I feel stupid, illogical
And later I imagine you gifting the scent of your skin
Your kisses, your eternal smile, and even soul in a kiss
A kiss that goes to the soul
And in my soul is the kiss that could've beenEmbed
