Where have all the pictures gone
This place was home was before you left
All my hopes, all my dreams
Tried to move on but I just couldn't feel my feet
Let her fly, into the sky
The tears remain under my eyes
Haven't seen her since that day
If I could reach her now this is what I would say

Wherever we go to
Whatever we do
It's only me, It's only you
Wherever we go to
Whatever we do
It's only me, It's only you


But I just couldn't feel my feet
Let her fly, into the sky
The tears remain under my eyes
Haven't seen her since that day
If I could reach her now this is what I would say

I would play this from the start
Wrote our names out on the tree
Holding on, forever's arms
Oh that innocence It melts my heart
Hand in hand, through fields of gold
I'd do the same even when we get old
Haven't seen her since that day
If I could reach her now this is what I would say

Wherever we go to
Whatever we do
It's only me, It's only you
Wherever we go to
Whatever we do
It's only me, It's only you

Wherever we go to
Whatever we do
It's only me, It's only you
Wherever we go to
Whatever we do
It's only me, It's only you
Wherever we go to
Whatever we do
It's only me, It's only you
Wherever we go to
Whatever we do
It's only me, It's only you
