Stuck here in my love sick night
And I've been trying
To pick myself up of the floor
And I'd been lying
Say'n' I don't want you anymore
You got my blind heart holden onto you
And I don't know where it's going
Or what it will do
And I try to control it
But control is what I lose
You got my blind heart holden onto you
Just let it be (just let it be)
Just let it be (just let it be)
Just let it be (just let it be)
Just let it be (just let it be)
Just let it be (just let it be)
Just let it be (just let it be)
You've got my blind heart holden onto you
(You've got my blind, yeah)
(You've got my blind, yeah)
(You've got my blind, yeah)
(You've got my blind, yeah)
You've got my blind heart holden onto you
I'm in pieces like a puzzle
Scattered all around this room
I need to put this back together
You twisted up my point of view
No, I've been trying
To pick myself up of the floor
And it'd be lying
To say I don't want you anymore
You got my blind heart holden onto you
And I don't know where it's going
Or what it will do
And I try to control it
But control is what I lose
You got my blind heart holden onto you
Oh no, I don't know, oh
Oh no, I don't know, oh
Oh no, I don't know, oh
Oh no, I don't know-ow-ow
You got my blind heart holden onto you
And I don't know where it's going
Or what it will do
And I try to control it
But control is what I lose
You got my blind heart holden onto you
