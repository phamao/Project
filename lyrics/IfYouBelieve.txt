4 ContributorsIf You Believe Lyrics[Intro: Patch Crowe]
If you believe, you can move the highest mountains
Cross the greatest oceans and walk across the water, the water

[Verse 1: Patch Crowe]
You feel defeated, falling on your knees, and
Looking up for some hope tonight
You try to stand up, but you throw your hands up
Like you no longer have the strength to fight
'Cause you've seen too many sunsets, too many days
Ending in the darkest night
But, on your own, you'll never know
You'll never know

[Chorus: Patch Crowe]
If you believe, you can move the highest mountains
Cross the greatest ocеans, walk across the water, the watеr
Believe, you can move the highest mountains
Cross the greatest oceans, walk across the water
If you believe

[Verse 2: Patch Crowe]
They say that all you need is faith
But it's almost like you lost your way
Took a few wrong turns, took a few breaks
Falling behind now, looking for grace
'Cause you need someone to lift you up
Yeah, make right all the things you've done
'Cause on your own, you'll never know
You'll never know

Believe, you can move the highest mountains
Cross the greatest oceans, walk across the water
If you believe

[Post-Chorus]
If you believe, yeah

[Bridge: Patch Crowe]
You can do anything, you can do anything
You can do anything if you believe

[Chorus: Patch Crowe]
If you believe, you can move the highest mountains
Cross the greatest oceans, walk across the water, the water
Believe, you can move the highest mountains
Cross the greatest oceans, walk across the water
If you believeEmbed
