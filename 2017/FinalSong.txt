At least until the sun goes down
When you're gone, I lose faith
I lose everything I have found
Heartstrings, violins
That's what I hear when you're by my side
Yeah, that's what I hear when you're by my side

Well, when you're gone the music goes
I lose my rhythm, lose my soul
So hear me out before you say the night is over
I want you to know that we gotta, gotta carry on
So don't let this be our final song

So don't let this be our final song
So hear me out before you say the night is over
I want you to know that we gotta, gotta carry on
So don't let this be our final song

Baby when we were young
There was nothing to make believe
And the songs that we sang
They were written for you and me
Melodies on repeat
That's what I hear when you're by my side (Ooh)
Yeah, that's what I hear when you're by my side (Ooh)
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Well, when you're gone the music goes
I lose my rhythm, lose my soul
So hear me out before you say the night is over
I want you to know that we gotta, gotta carry on
So don't let this be our final song

So don't let this be our final song
So hear me out before you say the night is over
I want you to know that we gotta, gotta carry on
So don't let this be our final song

Ooh-ooh, take us to a higher ground
Here and now, whatever you do, just don't look down
Ooh-ooh, underneath the disco light, it's alright
We could make the perfect sound
We could make the perfect sound

Well, when you're gone the music goes
I lose my rhythm, lose my soul
So hear me out before you say the night is over
I want you to know that we gotta, gotta carry on
So don't let this be our final song (Hey)
So don't let this be our final song (Hey)
So hear me out before you say the night is over
I want you to know that we gotta, gotta carry on
So don't let this be our final song (Hey)

Ooh-ooh, take us to a higher ground
Here and now, whatever you do, just don't look down
(Don't look down)
Ooh-ooh (Hey), underneath the disco light, it's alright
We could make the perfect sound
Ooh-ooh, take us to a higher ground
Here and now, whatever you do, just don't look down
(Don't look down)
Ooh-ooh, underneath the disco light, it's alright
Don't let this be our final song
