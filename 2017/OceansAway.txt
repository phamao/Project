25 ContributorsOceans Away Lyrics[Verse 1]
I never let
My guard go down
But you messed me up
When you came around
When the high wore off
Know you needed space
But I don't wanna wait
I don't wanna mistake

[Pre-Chorus]
Few thousand miles, and an ocean away
But I see the sunrise, just like the other day
Picture your eyes as I fall asleep
Tell myself it's alright
As the tears roll by

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh
I wish I could feel your face
Oh, oh, oh
I'm helpless when I'm oceans away

[Verse 2]
I never felt
A room so still
See the future coming
Hope it isn't real
I learned to fake a smile
As the time runs out
I don't wanna wait
Oh, I don't wanna mistake

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh
I wish I could feel your face
Oh, oh, oh
I'm helpless when I'm oceans away
Oh, oh, oh
I wish I could feel your face
Oh, oh, oh
I'm helpless when I'm oceans away

Helpless when I'm oceans away
I'm helpless when I'm oceans away

[Outro]
Oh, oh, oh
I wish I could feel your face
Oh, oh, oh
I'm helpless when I'm oceans away13Embed
