Never thought I'd see the end of grain
Now I know I gotta get away
I need to kill the pain
Wanna see what's on the other side
Gotta know that there is more to life
Come along and open up my eyes
I wanna see the fire

I'm calling for you desperately
To save me and be my remedy
And take me to a better place
And come with me

We are young, on the run
Let the love free your mind
We can be who we are
Like we never will die
When the sun's coming up
We'll be higher than stars
And I wanna wake up where you are

Hold me close and never let me go
Wanna dance until the high runs out
We're not ready for the afterglow
So hit me one more time
If tomorrow ever gets me down
Gotta keep on being on the run
'Cause I wanna live without a line
Between the moon and sun
You might also like[Pre-Chorus 2]
Release me, kill my misery
And redirect my destiny
We're heading for a better day
So far away

We are young, on the run
Let the love free your mind
We can be who we are
Like we never will die
When the sun's coming up
We'll be higher than stars
And I wanna wake up where you are

And I wanna wake up where you are


We are young, on the run
Let the love free your mind
We can be who we are
Like we never will die
When the sun's coming up
We'll be higher than stars
And I wanna wake up where you are
And I wanna wake up where you are
