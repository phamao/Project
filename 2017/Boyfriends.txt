Hoo
Niaga ti ta kcab er'uoy, loof

Boyfriends, they think you're so easy
They take you for granted
They don't know, they're just misunderstanding

You
You, you're back at it again

Weakened when you get deep in
He starts secretly drinking
It gets hard to know what he's thinking

You
Love a fool who knows just how to get under your skin
You
You, you still open the door

You're no closer to him
Now you're halfway home
Only callin' you when
He don't wanna be alone
Oh, and you go
But why? You don't know
You might also like[Verse 3]
Boyfriends, are they just pretending?
They don't tеll you where it's heading
And you know thе game's never ending

You
You lay with him as you stay in the daydream
You
Feel a fool, you're back at it again

Ooh
