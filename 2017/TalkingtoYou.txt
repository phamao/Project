Yeah, I'm talking to you
Yeah, I'm talking to you
Yeah, I'm talking to you

Just for what was you waiting?
Never seem to fear your hesitating
I'll be there when you wake up, darling
(Yeah, I'm talking to you)
God knows just how you're feeling
What a shock to your system, overload
I'll be there when you wake up, darling

Yeah, I'm talking to you
Yeah, I'm talking to you
Yeah, I'm talking to you
Yeah, I'm talking to you

And just the tears, the pressure's building up
I can't stand you wasting and giving up
I'll be there when you wake up, darling
(Yeah, I'm talking to you)
Sometimes they don't know the answer
She said there's nothing they could give ya
I'll be there when you wake up, darling
You might also like[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm talking to you
Yeah, I'm talking to you
Yeah, I'm talking to you
Yeah, I'm talking to you

Just like a needle right through your chest
And if hurts just to forget
I'll be your pain reliever with a burning fever
(Yeah, I'm talking to you)
Or when you feel like you've had enough
And it just gets too much
I'll be there when you wait, just another day, yeah

Yeah, I'm talking to you
Yeah, I'm talking to you
Yeah, I'm talking to you
Yeah, I'm talking to you
Yeah, I'm talking to you
Yeah, I'm talking to you
Yeah, I'm talking to you
Yeah, I'm talking to you
Yeah, I'm talking to you
Yeah, I'm talking to you
And just the tears, the pressure's building up
I can't stand you wasting and giving up
I'll be there when you wake up, darling
