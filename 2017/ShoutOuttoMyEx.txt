This is a shout out to my ex
Heard he in love with some other chick
Yeah, yeah, that hurt me, I'll admit
Forget that boy, I'm over it
I hope she gettin' better sex (Ha)
Hope she ain't fakin' it like I did, babe
Took four long years to call it quits
Forget that boy, I'm over it

Guess I should say thank you
For the "hate you"s and the tattoos
Oh, baby, I'm cool by the way
Ain't sure I loved you, anyway
Go 'head, babe, I'ma live my life, my life, yeah

Shout out to my ex, you're really quite the man
You made my heart break and that made me who I am
Here's to my ex, hey, look at me now
Well, I, I'm all the way up, I swear you'll never bring me down
Shout out to my ex (Woo!), you're really quite the man
You made my heart break and that made me who I am
Here's to my ex (Woo!), hey, look at me now
Well, I'm, I'm all the way up, I swear you'll never, you'll never bring me down
