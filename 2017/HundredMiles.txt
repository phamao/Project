Come here and visit my world
Come here and visit my world
Dead history, shinin' stars

Don't get lost 'cause I am waitin'
Summer feelings are waitin', boy

Dance with me one more time

You and me is more than the grey sky
You and me is more than the lonely days
It's our time to go
Dance with me one more time
