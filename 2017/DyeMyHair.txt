12 ContributorsDye My Hair Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm not that kinda girl to keep my voice unheard
To carefully pick words, oh no
I'm not that kinda girl to easily get hurt
No bullets pierce my eyes shut

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But there's something in the way I act around you
Tryna turn your head
Laugh at jokes that I don't get
There is something in the way I act around you
The way I feel about you
Not a thing I wouldn't do

[Chorus]
I will dye my hair blonde for you
I will dye my hair blonde for you
You got that mad power, the sweet and sour
You won't cut me loose
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
I will dye my hair blonde for you
I will dye my hair blonde for you
You got that mad power, the sweet and sour
You won't cut me loose
There's nothing that I wouldn't do

Don't buy me fancy things
Don't buy me any drinks
I pay for my own sins, oh yeah
I was raised to be free
Got my independency
Why do I get so weak?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause there's something in the way I act around you
Tryna turn your head
Laugh at jokes that I don't get
There is something in the way I act around you
The way I feel about you
Not a thing I wouldn't do

[Chorus]
I will dye my hair blonde for you
I will dye my hair blonde for you
You got that mad power, the sweet and sour
You won't cut me loose
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
I will dye my hair blonde for you
I will dye my hair blonde for you
You got that mad power, the sweet and sour
You won't cut me loose
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
I will dye my hair blonde for you
I will dye my hair blonde for you
You got that mad power, the sweet and sour
So how could I refuse?
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
[Bridge]
But there's something in the way I act around you
Around you, around you
But there's something in the way I act around you
The way I feel about you
Not a thing I wouldn't do

[Chorus]
I will dye my hair blonde for you
I will dye my hair blonde for you
You got that mad power, the sweet and sour
You won't cut me loose
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
I will dye my hair blonde for you
I will dye my hair blonde for you
You got that mad power, the sweet and sour
So how could I refuse?
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
I will dye my hair blonde for you4Embed
