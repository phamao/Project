Oh, why?
Ooh, woo, why?
Ooh, woo, why?

Girl, just come home with me
You in the passenger side when I'm drivin'
Girl, you kissin' all on me
Lickin' my neck while my hand's on your thigh
And I'm makin' that pussy leak
Knowin' just what you want
'Cause you ain't had dick in a week
And I know that you a freak, oh, girl

Girl, I know you're down for playin'
I know you're listenin' to what I'm sayin'
Your body done started up this conversation
We should really take this inside, when I'm inside
Girl, let's get it
(Let's get it, let's get it, let's get it)

We party all night, then you leave in the mornin'
Girl, when you ride it, act like you performin'
You a bad muh'fucker, you the shit right now
Play your position, we switchin' positions, lights out (Ayy)

Girl, I'm 'bout to lay the sheets down and I'ma eat it on the floor
You'll see what you mean to me, but first, I need you on all fours now
Ass up, face down, when we're lovin'
Slow motion, in and out
Girl, when you rain, I'ma break you off
Really need to take them panties off
Your body on my body, drippin' wet, baby
Lickin' on it, got my dick way too hard
Girl, I'm just in it explorin'
I got the camera recordin'
Makin' that pussy too sore
Then you get it again in the mornin' (Ha)

Fur on the couch, lips soft, fresh out the shower

Take it to the kitchen, so many different positions (Bitch)
Fuck her real slow, she talkin', I like to listen (Get it)
On the roll with it, she don't like to pay attention
All this money on my mind, but the pussy what I'm missin' (Missin')
Skip the penitentiary, I'm left wrist whippin' (Whip)
Sneakin', we freakin', no sleep on the weekend
But I just wanna hit it by the lake
From the back, from the front while I'm grippin' on her face (On her face)
I just wanna give her what you can't
Fly her all around the world, poppin' bottles of the Ace (Bottles of the Ace)
I just wanna take her to the bank
Shoppin' trip, what you get? DC, LA (LA)
