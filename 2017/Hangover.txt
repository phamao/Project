Hangover, hangover, hangover, hangover-over-over (Hangover)
Hangover, hangover, hangover, hangover-over-over (Hangover)
Party's over, it ain't over
Try to make a bad memory over and over
Hangover, hangover, hangover, hangover-over-over (Hangover)
Hangover, hangover, hangover, hangover-over-over (Hangover)
Party's over, it ain't over
Cannot find a single piece of me, game over

Hangover
Hangover
(Hangover, hangover, hangover, hangover-over-over)
(Hangover, hangover, hangover, hangover-over-over)
Hangover
(Hangover, hangover, hangover, hangover-over-over)
Cannot find a single piece of me, game over (Hey)
Drink 'til you're drunk, smoke like a broke stove
Don't quit, take flight, I can't remember last night
It's aight, this the life of a superstar
Sci-fi with that boy trooping hard, couping cars
Snoop be hard in the paint, drink another cup until I fall flat
All lead and then some 1-5-1, done dilly
Really for sure that, I'm throw back intoxicated
Change over, game over, hangover, faded
Body shit miss
대체 어디 있으
꾀꼬리 못 찾겠어
Eeny-eeny, meeny, miny, moe
Catch a lady by the toe
안 예쁘면 예뻐 보일
때까지 빠라삐리뽀 (Hey)

Drink it up and get sick
Bottom's up, get wasted
Pour it up, drink it up, live it up, give it up
Oh my God, dammit, there's the fucking limit
Pour it up, drink it up, live it up, give it up (Hey)

받으시오
But I can't stop
Making bottles pop until the wheels fall off (Hey)
받으시오
And I can't quit
I wake up in the morning, do the same shit (Hey)
Wake up in the morning, do the same shit

Hangover
Hangover

Cannot find a single piece of me, game over (Hey)

Waking and baking, shaking the fleas
Caking and baking, raking the cheese
Early in the morning in the bathroom on my knees
Tipping and dripping, flipping the flow
Whipping and dripping a drink on the floor
This is the only way that I was taught a long time ago
Seoul, Korea, you'll see a G-a like me-a
Never would there ever be another like he-a
G-A-N-G-S-T-A, nothing left to say
I done smoked my whole day (Uh)
베이비 나를 시험해 (Hey)
어서 나를 시험해 (Hey)
거시기가 거시기하니
거시기하고 거시기해 (Hey)
내일은 없다 에라 (에라)
모르겠다 내 배를 째라 (째라)
내일의 나는 오늘의
너를 백프로 몰라 (몰라) 에 (Hey)

Drink it up and get sick
