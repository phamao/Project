I need a little sunshine
I fell into your brown eyes
I told you I was your light

No, I don't wanna talk about it
I don't wanna listen all that much
Let's fall apart
I don't wanna talk about it
I just wanna hold your hand

Oh you know when you're alone
I'm holding on, and on, and on, and on
Oh you know when you're alone
I'm holding on, and on, and on, and on
I'm holding on to your soul
Your soul
I'm holding on
And you know, you know, you know
I'm holding on to your soul
I'm holding on to your soul
I'm holding on to your soul
I'm holding on to your soul

Soul shine
You must've been so tired
Don't cry
I must've been so blind

Oh you know when you're alone
I'm holding on, and on, and on, and on
Oh you know when you're alone
And I'm holding on, and on, and on, and on
I'm holding on to your soul
Your soul
I'm holding on
And you know, you know, you know
I'm holding on to your soul
I'm holding on to your soul
I'm holding on to your soul
I'm holding on to your soul
