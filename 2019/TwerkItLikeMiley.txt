Let's see that badonkadonk
I'ma try to do the things that you don't
Baby, it's yo party, I just wanna play
What's that sound?
What's that thang that's got me like "wow"?
I'm tryna beat, beat it up 12 rounds
Girl, look at that body, I just gotta say

When you back, back, back, back, back it up
And you drop it down low
And you pick, pick, pick, pick, pick it up
Girl, I'm ready to blow
I'ma stack, stack, stack, stack, stack it up
And I'm spending it all
When I throw, throw, throw, throw, throw it up

Start twerkin' like Miley
Twerkin' like Miley
Start twerkin' like Miley
Twerkin' like Miley

You got everybody in this club lookin' at you, girl
How you move that thing from side to side
Fuck everybody in this club, 'cause I got you, girl
I'ma tell you what's goin' down tonight
Girl, it's gon' rain, that's that sound
That's that shit that's got you like "wow"
And would you let me beat, beat 12 rounds
Baby, look at that body, I just gotta say

When you back, back, back, back, back it up (Oh)
And you drop it down low
And you pick, pick, pick, pick, pick it up
Girl, I'm ready to blow

And I'm spending it all

I know you wore them jeans
So I can see that thong, thong, thong, thong, thong
(Thong, thong, thong, thong, thong)
Pop it like Miley
And don't forget that tongue, tongue, tongue, tongue, tongue
Tongue, tongue, tongue, tongue, tongue
Twenty more shots then I pass out
But that's what I'm aiming for
Baby, let me drown
When I wake up, I'm still in the club
Looking at the DJ, like turn my shit up, oh
So when the beat, beat, beat, beat, beat drops
Get your ass on the floor
Start twerkin' like Miley (Oh, start twerkin' like Miley)
Twerkin' like Miley (Ooh-ooh, don't get it, get it, girl)
Start twerkin' like Miley (Oh-oh, ooh)
