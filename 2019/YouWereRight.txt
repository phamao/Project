Leave it all to bloom
You were right
I know I can't get enough of you, no
The things that I would do

Under the water, I'm sinking further down
Floating, I'm nothing, I'm nothing, mmm
Arms are wide open, I'm calling out your name
Sitting and waiting, I'm waiting, mmm

You were right
I know I can't get enough of you
You were right
I know I can't get enough of you
Leave it all to bloom
You were right
I know I can't get enough of you, no
The things that I would do

I'm cold in the river, lips moving, there's no sound
Pulling me under, I'm under, mmm
You've given me nothing, keep telling me I'll be fine
Keeping me guessing, I'm guessing, mmm
