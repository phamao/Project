6 ContributorsStay a While Lyrics[Verse 1]
When the stars start to fall
Will you love me? Will you call?
I need you close, don't run away...
Don't run away
Chasing highs in the midnight sun
We fought for love, we were on the run
Tried my best to give you what you need
So one more chance, please don't leave

[Chorus]
Made it way past broken hearts
Won't you stay a while, stay a while
We are still on the run
Never had enough, never catching us

Never catching us
Never catching us

[Verse 2]
All these lights got me in a daze
I've been lost, haven't slept in days
I need you close, don't run away, don't run away
I want you by my side, I hope you never leave
I'll just keep holding on, I'll just be all you need
This life is all we know, this life is all we know
You might also like[Chorus]
Made it way past broken hearts
Won't you stay a while, stay a while
We are still on the run
Never had enough, never catching us

Never catching us
Never catching us

[Chorus]
Made it way past broken hearts
Won't you stay a while, stay a while
We are still on the run
Never had enough, never catching us
Made it way past broken hearts
Won't you stay a while, stay a while
We are still on the run
Never had enough, never catching us

Never had enough
Okay
(Never catching us)
(Never catching us)
(Never catching us)1Embed
