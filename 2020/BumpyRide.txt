It's gonna be a bumpy ride
I wanna boom-bang-bang with your body, oh
We gonna rough it up before we take it slow
Girl, let me rock you, rock you like a rodeo
It's gonna be a bumpy ride
I wanna boom-bang-bang with your body, oh
We gonna rough it up before we take it slow
Girl, let me rock you, rock you like a rodeo (Mohambi)
It's gonna be a bumpy ride (RedOne, man)

I'm gonna pull you over, pull you under
Make your body surrender to mine (Ooh-ayy-oh)
Girl, you can make me suffer, do whatever
'Cause I know you're one of a kind (Ooh-ayy-oh)

Tell me, who can love you? (Nobody)
Hold you? (Nobody)
Make your body wine like me
You'll never find someone like me
Who can love you? (Nobody)
Hold you? (Nobody)
Make your body wine like me
You'll never find someone like me
You might also like[Chorus]

Oh, I ain't plannin' to stop (Ooh-ayy-oh)
Let me take you down to the bottom
Work you all the way to the top (Ooh-ayy-oh)

Tell me, who can love you? (Nobody)
Hold you? (Nobody)
