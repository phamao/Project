8 ContributorsLot to Learn Lyrics[Chorus]
If I was the question, would you be my answer?
If I was the music, would you be the dancer?
If I was the student, would you be the teacher?
If I was the sinner, would you be the preacher?
Would you be my (What?) (Dun-dun-dun)
I still got a lot of shit to learn, I'll admit it (Dun-dun-dun)
I still got a lot of shit to learn, I'll admit it

[Verse 1]
Feeling like a digit in a system, just another stupid number
I don't know, know, know
Everything is twisted I can feel it
It's another stupid summer where it's cold, cold, cold
And we can do it on our own
Head up to a place where baby no one goes
A rocket full of liquor and a Polaroid for pictures
Baby, you should stop me before I lose control

[Pre-Chorus]
How imperfect a person am I
Go through your purse and put on your disguise
You see the stars, but they just see the skies
And you see my scars; what do they see?

[Chorus]
If I was the question, would you be my answer?
If I was the music, would you be the dancer?
If I was the student, would you be the teacher?
If I was the sinner, would you be the preacher?
Would you be my (What?) (Dun-dun-dun)
I still got a lot of shit to learn, I'll admit it (Dun-dun-dun)
I still got a lot of shit to learn, I'll admit it
You might also like[Bridge]
And dun-dun-dun
We still got a lot of shit to learn, just admit it
And dun-dun-dun
We still got a lot of shit to learn, don't you get it?

[Verse 2]
Got your finger on the trigger and you aiming at the mirror
Don't you shoot that ain't you, nah
'Cause on the outside you pretend but you hurting in the inner
What's the truth, what's the truth now?

[Pre-Chorus]
How imperfect a person am I
Go through your purse and put on your disguise
You see the stars, but they just see the skies
And you see my scars; what do they see?

[Chorus]
If I was the question, would you be my answer?
If I was the music, would you be the dancer?
If I was the student, would you be the teacher?
If I was the sinner, would you be the preacher?
Would you be my (What?) (Dun-dun-dun)
I still got a lot of shit to learn, I'll admit it (Dun-dun-dun)
I still got a lot of shit to learn, I'll admit it
[Verse 3]
Yeah, cheers to the fact that you're living in, this is your world
They say they ain't feeling you, they living' in the old world
Word to my old girl, and word to me too
I only say it and I might because I need to
Feeling like I'm see-through and life is a window
I be runnin' opposite the way that the wind blow
You pick up the pieces of the things that you didn't know
So when you hear the top you better scream that you been though

[Chorus]
If I was the question, would you be my answer?
If I was the music, would you be the dancer?
If I was the student, would you be the teacher?
If I was the sinner, would you be the preacher?
Would you be my (What?) (Dun-dun-dun)
I still got a lot of shit to learn, I'll admit it (Dun-dun-dun)
I still got a lot of shit to learn, I'll admit it
If I was the question, would you be my answer?
If I was the music, would you be the dancer?
If I was the student, would you be the teacher?
If I was the sinner, would you be the preacher?
If I was the question, would you be my answer?
If I was the music, would you be the dancer?
If I was the student, would you be the teacher?
If I was the sinner, would you be the preacher?
Would you be my (What?) (Dun-dun-dun)
I still got a lot of shit to learn, I'll admit it (Dun-dun-dun)
I still got a lot of shit to learn, I'll admit it1Embed
