I'm so alone, nothing feels like home
I'm so alone, trying to find my way back home to you
I'm so alone, nothing feels like home
I'm so alone, trying to find my way back home to you
You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you
You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you
I'm so alone, trying to find my way back home to you


I'm so alone, nothing feels like home
I'm so alone, trying to find my way back home to you
I'm so alone, nothing feels like home
I'm so alone, trying to find my way back home to you
You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you
You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you
I'm so alone, trying to find my way back home to you
