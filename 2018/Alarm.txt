Your phone is buzzin', so pick it up
I know she callin', so what the fuck?
I should've known a cheat stays a cheater
So here we are

And there goes the alarm ringin' in my head
Like somebody said, "Don't you trust him, no"
Text in from his ex, what did you expect?
Now you're lyin' here knowin' where he goes
Now he got that itch, yeah, karma is a bitch, yeah
Same way that they come, that's the way they go
Now he got that itch, yeah, rewindin' the picture
There goes the alarm and the sirens go
There goes the alarm

I saw it comin', I let it go
My girls will tell me, "I told you so"
But I was so intrigued by your style, boy
Always been a sucker for a wild boy
I'm better than this, I know my worth
I might be gettin' what I deserve
But I ain't stickin' 'round for the re-run
What's done is done

And there goes the alarm ringin' in my head
Like somebody said, "Don't you trust him, no"
Text in from his ex, what did you expect?
Now you're lyin' here knowin' where he goes
Now he got that itch, yeah, karma is a bitch, yeah
Same way that they come, that's the way they go
Now he got that itch, yeah, rewindin' the picture
There goes the alarm and the sirens go
There goes the alarm

Now he got that itch, yeah
Same way that they come
Now he got that itch, yeah
There goes the alarm, yeah
Same way that they come
Now he got that itch, yeah, yeah, uh

Bang bang, two-shots fired
Man down, one fool, one liar
Ring ring, trust gone missin'
House on fire, house on fire
Bang bang, two-shots fired
Man down, one fool, one liar
Ring ring, trust gone missin'
House on fire
And there goes the alarm ringin' in my head
Like somebody said, "Don't you trust him, no" (No)
Text in from his ex, what did you expect?
Now you're lyin' here knowin' where he goes
Now he got that itch, yeah, karma is a bitch, yeah
Same way that they come, that's the way they go
Now he got that itch, yeah, rewindin' the picture
There goes the alarm and the sirens go

There goes the alarm
Now he got that itch, yeah
There goes the alarm
There goes the alarm
Now he got that itch, yeah
There goes the alarm
