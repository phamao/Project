48 ContributorsFinal Song Lyrics[Verse 1]
Please, won't you wait?
Won't you stay?
At least until the sun goes down
When you're gone, I lose faith
I lose everything I have found
Heartstrings, violins
That's what I hear when you're by my side
Yeah, that's what I hear when you're by my side

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, when you're gone the music goes
I lose my rhythm, lose my soul
So hear me out before you say the night is over
I want you to know that we gotta, gotta carry on
So don't let this be our final song

[Chorus]
So don't let this be our final song
So hear me out before you say the night is over
I want you to know that we gotta, gotta carry on
So don't let this be our final song

[Verse 2]
Baby when we were young
There was nothing to make believe
And the songs that we sang
They were written for you and me
Melodies on repeat
That's what I hear when you're by my side (Ooh)
Yeah, that's what I hear when you're by my side (Ooh)

Well, when you're gone the music goes
I lose my rhythm, lose my soul
So hear me out before you say the night is over
I want you to know that we gotta, gotta carry on
So don't let this be our final song

[Chorus]
So don't let this be our final song
So hear me out before you say the night is over
I want you to know that we gotta, gotta carry on
So don't let this be our final song

[Refrain]
Ooh-ooh, take us to a higher ground
Here and now, whatever you do, just don't look down
Ooh-ooh, underneath the disco light, it's alright
We could make the perfect sound
We could make the perfect sound

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, when you're gone the music goes
I lose my rhythm, lose my soul
So hear me out before you say the night is over
I want you to know that we gotta, gotta carry on
So don't let this be our final song (Hey)
[Chorus]
So don't let this be our final song (Hey)
So hear me out before you say the night is over
I want you to know that we gotta, gotta carry on
So don't let this be our final song (Hey)

Ooh-ooh, take us to a higher ground
Here and now, whatever you do, just don't look down
(Don't look down)
Ooh-ooh (Hey), underneath the disco light, it's alright
We could make the perfect sound
Ooh-ooh, take us to a higher ground
Here and now, whatever you do, just don't look down
(Don't look down)
Ooh-ooh, underneath the disco light, it's alright
Don't let this be our final song41Embed
