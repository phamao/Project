You forgot to smile, as I passed you by
Now we're sitting down for dinner, we got nothing to say
It's like I'm watching you slowly slipping away
From me, from me

Remember when I used to make you laugh?
And every joke was better than the last?
Tell me how to bring you back to this
Maybe I just need to reminisce and work it out

What happened to perfect?
What happened to us?
We used to be worth it
We never gave up
It wasn't on purpose
But it hurts like it was
Nobody deserves this
What happened to perfect?

If you left me, baby, where would you go?
I can't imagine you ever being alone
Iâ€™m a jealous man, but I'd try to understand
So many things to say, I don't know where to start
I can't pick up the pieces of a crumbling heart
So true, so true

Remember when I used to make you laugh?
And every joke was better than the last?
Tell me how to bring you back to this
Maybe I just need to reminisce and work it out

What happened to perfect?
What happened to us?
We used to be worth it
We never gave up
It wasn't on purpose
But it hurts like it was
Nobody deserves this
What happened to perfect?
What happened to perfect?

What's under the surface?
It used to be love
Would you call if you heard this?
Would you know it was us?
It wasn't on purpose
But it hurts like it was
Nobody deserves this
What happened to perfect?
Nobody deserves this
I can see it in your eyes as I'm stumbling home
You're living with a man you no longer know
You forgot to smile
