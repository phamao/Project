37 ContributorsFever Lyrics[Intro]
XOXO, my love is very special
If you want it, you can have it
But don't take me for granted
So much, so much
So much things I did not say
I'm from Portmore
That's in JA
We can do it on that beach deh

Bruk it, set it
Bruk it, set it
Bruk it, set it
Bruk it, set it

[Pre-Chorus]
Backshot

Forget me not
When it sweet you
