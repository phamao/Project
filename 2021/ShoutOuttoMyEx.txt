This is a shout out to my ex
Heard he in love with some other chick
Yeah, yeah, that hurt me, I'll admit
Forget that boy, I'm over it
I hope she gettin' better sex (Ha)
Hope she ain't fakin' it like I did, babe
Took four long years to call it quits
Forget that boy, I'm over it

[Pre-Chorus: Jade]
Guess I should say thank you
For the "hate you"s and the tattoos
Oh, baby, I'm cool by the way
Ain't sure I loved you, anyway
Go 'head, babe, I'ma live my life, my life, yeah

[Chorus: All]
Shout out to my ex, you're really quite the man
You made my heart break and that made me who I am
Here's to my ex, hey, look at me now
Well, I, I'm all the way up, I swear you'll never bring me down
Shout out to my ex (Woo!), you're really quite the man
You made my heart break and that made me who I am
Here's to my ex (Woo!), hey, look at me now
Well, I'm, I'm all the way up, I swear you'll never, you'll never bring me down
