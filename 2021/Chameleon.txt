Alright, yeah, go, peace when I get going (Go, go)
Chameleon keeps me a keep going (Come on, chameleon)
The pyramid tells me a sweet song (Go, go)
Chameleon keeps me a keep going (Come on, chameleon)

Peak and rock away, lean and walk away
Do you wanna stay? Do you love, I say?
Peak and rock away, lean and walk away
Do you wanna stay? Do you love, I say?

Come to the flicker of the sun with me
Can you come to the centre of the sun with me?
Saying we can rock with the rhythm wise
We can rock with the rhythm wise
We can rock with the rhythm wise
We can rock, rock, rock

I hear your footsteps walking to my door
Knock-a, knock-a, knock-a, bangin' loud
I hear your footsteps walking to my door
Knock-a, knock-a, knockin' on the floor
Eyo

Alright, yeah, go, peace when I get going (Go, go)
Chameleon keeps me a keep going (Come on, chameleon)
The pyramid tells me a sweet song (Go, go)
Chameleon keeps me a keep going (Come on, chameleon)

Eyo
Ah, ah-oh
Eyo
Ah, ah-oh

Come to the flicker of the sun with me
Can you come to the centre of the sun with me?
Saying we can rock with the rhythm wise
We can rock with the rhythm wise
We can rock with the rhythm wise
We can rock, rock, rock

Peak and rock away, lean and walk away
Do you wanna stay? Do you love, I say?
Peak and rock away, lean and walk away
Do you wanna stay?
Eyo
Ah, ah-oh
Eyo
Ah, ah-oh
