Got good things, got you
Hoops and everything
Get back, never get back too soon

Are you lonely? Are you there when I'm not in the room?
Are you only, only a part of this when you choose?
Is it real? Is it something that you can not touch?
Do you feel, do you feel that you feel too much?

Blood stains won't make it matter
Got good things, got you
Hoops and everything
Get back, never get back too soon
Blood stains make confusing patterns
They lead me to you
Hoops and everything
Get back, never get back too soon

Something crazy, something changing in the way you talk
You are lately, lately, you are trying to be the one on top
Come on down, come on and give it to me like you should
Gonna drown, I give up and get on with a life lived good

Say it all on the telephone
Say it in my head (Say it in my head)
Say it in my head (Say it in my head)
Say it in my head
Writing down all the things gone wrong (Gone wrong)
And the ink ran red (And the ink ran red)
And the ink ran red (And the ink ran red)
And the ink ran red

Blood stains won't make it matter
Got good things, got you
Hoops and everything
Get back, never get back too soon
Get back, never get back too soon
Get back, never get back too soon
Get back, never get back
Get back, never get back
Get back, never get back too soon
Get back, never get back too soon

Yes, it's true (Hoops and everything)
Get back, never get back
Get back, never get back too soon
Get back, never get back too soon
Get back, never get back
Get back, never get back
